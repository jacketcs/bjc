## About the Game

::: learn

You’re alone in a room with a bomb. Your friends, the “Experts”, have the manual needed to defuse it. But there’s a catch: the Experts can’t see the bomb, so everyone will need to talk it out – fast!

Put your puzzle-solving and communication skills to the test as you and your friends race to defuse bombs quickly before time runs out!

### So what do you do?

- In the game, you'll have a bomb on the "table", and you have to defuse it with a partner
    * Here's the catch: the person who can see the bomb doesn't have the instructions to defuse it and the person who has the instructions cannot see the bomb
    * Your goal is to communicate effectively so that the defuser (**driver**) knows what to do with the bomb and the manual reader (**navigator**) knows what instructions to provide to the defuser.

(@) At all the Mac computers, the game will be under the Applications folder (look for the folder with a triangle shape on the bottom right of the desktop menu bar)

(@) On the other computer/your phone, have the bomb manual open. [LINK TO THE BOMB MANUAL](http://www.bombmanual.com/)

(@) **Play the tutorial together** so that everyone knows how to work with the bomb.

(@) After the tutorial is done, jump right into the game. At this point, the defuser (person on the game) should not be looking at the manual in any form; likewise the manual reader should not be looking at the game at all. The only way for you to know what's going on in the other person's side is to keep talking to each other.
