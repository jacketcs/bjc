Welcome to the class! To get started, please first fill out the student information form in Google Classroom. We're just asking you to fill this out so that we know more about you and so that you can know more about us!

As for other things to check, please look at at the general expectations on the [home page](https://bjc.jacketcs.net/). These will always be there for you to look at and you are expected to follow them. Please also check anything else that is already on Google Classroom.
