<p>PG: I'm glad this now has references to the extensions (and is no
longer called Astrid). I like the idea of turtlifying it, though only
the hint directs students away from a turtle solution. Using the method
of locating the points by algorithm, storing them, then using that list
of coordinates will be simpler than pure turtle, possibly even for the
cardioid and other such envelopes inside a circle). I'd be inclined to
have it start with just the animated image, and another one, a bit
slower, animating the cardioid development in a circle (one end moves a
step at a time, the other end two steps for cardioid), letting kids
figure out what generating rule is involved. It's just personal taste,
but I find "With your partner discuss" to be such a lame schoolish Micky
Mouse instruction---no real setting tells us to discuss with our
partner. And what business, in an optional project do we have saying
"develop an algorithm and then use abstraction"? What sense does it make
for us to say how to do what students don't have to do at all? With the
slowly developing image (the current animation is just fine) students
should have enough information to invent, if they like.</p>

<strong>Why do this?</strong> To give the students a chance to apply
their skills of developing algorithms and using abstractions in the
context of a visual arts project. To motivate students with interest in
arts and to give them an opportunity to synthesize their artistic skills
with their knowledge of algorithms and coding.<br /> <strong>Why
here?</strong> At this point in the curriculum the students know enough
to be able to complete a computational visual art project with minimal
hand-holding.

<strong>In this project,</strong> you will create a mathematical art
design and explore its variations. (Click the picture to see an

This design uses straight lines to make shapes that look curved and is
sometimes sewn with thread or drawn on paper. Here are some examples of
and variations on this design made with string, computers, pencils on
paper, and even pencils glued together:

<li>With your partner discuss how to make this design. Develop an
<em>algorithm</em> that will generate the first quadrant of the design
and then use <em>abstraction</em> to extend the design to the other
quadrants.</li>

<li>

Write a Snap<em>!</em> program to generate the design.

Use what you know about creating animations in Snap<em>!</em> to produce
an animation based on this design. To allow for dynamic movements such
as rotations, you will need to devise a completely different way of
creating your design than using fixed coordinates.\
