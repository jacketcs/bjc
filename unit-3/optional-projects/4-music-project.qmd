This page needs KEEP SUCH THAT updated. --MF, 6/22/20

<p>PG: I'd very much want to have a map-onto-scale one. (I have an
example somewhere.) Kids who care about music will find the switches
interesting, and even kids who claim not to be able to hear the
differences will.</p>

<p>BH: This is fine as far as it goes, but it calls out for more,
starting with a note-name-to-midi-number reporter, and then making a
round.</p>

<p>MF: BH has reviewing to do (see TG)</p>

<p>This page has been renumbered; need to check if this throws off the
numbering in the solutions or TG. --MF, 4/26/19</p>

<h3>Reviewing Higher-Order Functions with Sound</h3>

::: forYouToDo
<ol start="3">

<li>

Build and compare these <code>play</code> scripts. Run each script a few
times.

<ol>

::: sidenote
The inputs values given to the <code>play note</code> block are musical
pitches. Higher values create higher notes. You can input any integer
from 0 and 127. The number 60 represents middle C.

<h3>Creating an Abstract Data Type to Organize Musical Data</h3>

::: forYouToDo
<ol start="4">

<li>

::: sidenoteBig
<p><em>Pitch</em> is the amount of highness or lowness of a musical
note; the pitch value goes in the first input slot of the <code>play
note</code> block.</p>

<p>The <em>length</em> of a note is the amount of time that the note
plays (the number of beats); the length value goes in the second slot of
<code>play note</code>.</p>
:::

Create a <code>note</code> ADT to manage the pitch and length of each
note in a song.

<ol>

<li>Create the constructor:<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/note-constructor.png" title="note, pitch: () length: ()" alt="note, pitch: () length: ()" class="indent"/></li>

<li>Create two selectors:<br />

<img src="/img/3-lists/note-selector-length.png" title="length from note: ()" alt="length from note: ()" class="indent"/></li>

<h3>Creating Blocks to Play Music</h3>

::: forYouToDo

<li>Use <code>for each</code> together with your selectors to build a
<img src="/img/3-lists/play-song-block.png" title="play song {}" alt="play song {}" class="inline nopadtb"/><a name="playsong" class="anchor">Â </a>block
that takes a list of notes as input and plays each <var>pitch</var> for

<li>Create a reporter to reports the notes for a song of your choosing.
Here's an example:<br />

<img src="/img/icons/save-mini.png" title="Save Your Work" alt="Save Your Work" class="imageRight"/></li>

<li>Test your song with your <code>play song</code> block, and debug any
problems.<br />

BPM stands for "beats per minute."
:::

<li>Use the
<img src="/img/3-lists/set-tempo-to-empty.png" title="set tempo to () bpm" alt="set tempo to () bpm" class="inline"/>
block to change the pace at which the notes are played. A higher number
will make your song play faster; a lower number will make it play
slower.</li>

<h3>Transposing Music</h3>

::: forYouToDo
<ol start="9">

<li><img src="/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" title="Talk with Your Partner" alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="imageRight"/>
Compare the output of these two scripts that you created above. Discuss
what <code>map + 5</code> does to the sounds you hear:<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/compare-play-note-2.png" title="for each (note) of (list (60) (64) (67) (72) (60)) (play note (note) for (1) beats)" alt="for each (note) of (list (60) (64) (67) (72) (60)) (play note (note) for (1) beats)" class="indent"/><br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/compare-play-note-3.png" title="for each (note) of (map (_ + 5) over (list (60) (64) (67) (72) (60))) (play note (note) for (1) beats)" alt="for each (note) of (map (_ + 5) over (list (60) (64) (67) (72) (60))) (play note (note) for (1) beats)" class="indent"/></li>

<li>

Use <code>map</code> together with your ADT blocks to create a reporter
that transposes (shifts) a list of notes. It should take a list of notes
and a number indicating how much to transpose (shift) the song as input,
and it should report the adjusted song. For example:<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/play-song-transpose-row-row-row-by-19.png" title="play song (transpose (row row row your boat) by (19))" alt="play song (transpose (row row row your boat) by (19))" class="indent"/>

<li>Try playing your song using your <code>transpose</code> block with
several different shift numbers so that you can <em>hear</em> the impact
of <code>map</code>.</li>

Doesn't work in Snap<em>!</em> but would have been a nice way to tie the
