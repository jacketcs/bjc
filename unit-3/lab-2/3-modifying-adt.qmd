<p><strong>Purpose (do/learn; why this/here):</strong> Extend the ADT by
adding a <code>date</code> ADT, adapting the <code>contact</code> ADT to
accept it, and adding more helper blocks.</p>

<p>Can we cut all the commented out text on this page? --MF, 7/22/19</p>

<p>MARY: change the DATE ADT to use the correct ADT format. --MF,
5/23/20</p>

<p>BRIAN: as a low priority (that is, after ALL the solutions for all
units and all optional projects are done), you want to add a "parse a
date" TIF. --MF, 5/23/20</p>
:::

::: learn
<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop an abstract data type
(ADT) to store and access <em>dates</em>, and you will adapt your
contact ADT to use it to store each contact's birthday.<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-birthdate.png" title="contact with name: ... birthday: (date (July) (9) (2005))" alt="contact with name: ... birthday: (date (July) (9) (2005))" class="indent"/></p>
:::

::: takeNote
<p>As we add more complexity to contacts---birthday, work address, and
so on---the location of each data point (such as the phone number)
inside a contact might change. This is where an abstract data type
helps. If you were to move the phone number as you refine your contact
ADT, you <em>could</em> fix every single block that uses the phone
number, or if you have an ADT, you could just fix the one
<em>selector</em> that chooses the phone number from the list. With that
one change, all the other blocks using that selector will get the data
they need automatically.</p>

<p>Notice that name, address, and text are strings, but birthdate is a
list. You can combine elements of different types in a list.</p>

<ol>

<li>

Create an ADT to manage three data points for each date:
<var>month</var>, <var>day</var>, and <var>year</var>.

<ol>

<li>Create a <code>date</code> <em>constructor</em> that accepts this
data as input and then reports a date as a list of three items. <br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/date-constructor-reporting.png" title="date (July) (9) (2005) reporting {July, 9, 2005}" alt="date (July) (9) (2005) reporting {July, 9, 2005}" class="indent"/></li>

<li>Write three <em>selector</em> blocks to retrieve the specific data
(month, day, or year) from the inputted date. <br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/date-constructor-in-month-selector-reporting.png" title="month from date: () reporting July" alt="month from date: () reporting July" class="indent"/>
<img src="/img/3-lists/date-constructor-in-day-selector-reporting.png" title="day from date: () reporting 9" alt="day from date: () reporting 9" class="indent"/>
<img src="/img/3-lists/date-constructor-in-year-selector-reporting.png" title="year from date: () reporting 2005" alt="year from date: () reporting 2005" class="indent"/></li>

<li><strong>Debug</strong> any problems with the constructor or
selectors.</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>

Integrate your <code>date</code> ADT into the <code>contact</code> ADT.

<ul>

<li>Edit the <code>contact</code> constructor block definition to accept
a birthdate as a list by using the <code>date</code> constructor. <br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-date-reporting.png" title="contact with name: (Betsy) address: (123 Main St., New York NY 10001) phone: (212-555-1234) birthdate: (date (July) (9) (2005)) reporting {Betsy, 123 Main St., New York NY 10001, 212-555-1234, {July, 9, 2005}}" alt="contact with name: (Betsy) address: (123 Main St., New York NY 10001) phone: (212-555-1234) birthdate: (date (July) (9) (2005)) reporting {Betsy, 123 Main St., New York NY 10001, 212-555-1234, {July, 9, 2005}}" class="indent"/></li>

<li>Create a <code>birthdate from contact</code> <em>selector</em> to
retrieve the contact birthdate from the inputted contact.<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/birthdate-from-contact-reporting.png" title="birthdate from contact: (contact with name: (Betsy) address: (123 Main St., New York NY 10001) phone: (212-555-1234) birthdate: (date (July) (9) (2005))) reporting {July, 9, 2005}" alt="birthdate from contact: (contact with name: (Betsy) address: (123 Main St., New York NY 10001) phone: (212-555-1234) birthdate: (date (July) (9) (2005))) reporting {July, 9, 2005}" class="indent"/></li>

<li>

Adapt your "Add Contact" button to input this new type of contact into
your list.

<h4><strong>Adding Contacts with Birthdays</strong></h4>

<p>You could use several ask and answer blocks together with script
variables.</p>

<p>

Another way is to use <em>abstraction</em> and create another helper,
<img src="/img/3-lists/ask-birthdate.png" title="ask birthdate" alt="ask birthdate" class="inlinde"/>
that reports a list of the user's answers to these prompts:

<ul>

<li>What is the contact's birth month?</li>

<li>What is the contact's birth day?</li>

<li>What is the contact's birth year?</li>

</ul>

<img src="/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-date-with-helpers.png" title="contact with name: (ask name) address: (ask address) phone: (ask phone) birthdate: (ask birthdate)" alt="contact with name: (ask name) address: (ask address) phone: (ask phone) birthdate: (ask birthdate)" class="indent"/>

<li><strong>Debug.</strong> Clear your <code>contact list</code>, and
add a new few contacts with birthdays. Fix any problems.</li>
