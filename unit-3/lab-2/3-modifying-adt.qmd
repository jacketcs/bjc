**Purpose (do/learn; why this/here):** Extend the ADT by
adding a `date` ADT, adapting the `contact` ADT to
accept it, and adding more helper blocks.

Can we cut all the commented out text on this page? --MF, 7/22/19

MARY: change the DATE ADT to use the correct ADT format. --MF,
5/23/20

BRIAN: as a low priority (that is, after ALL the solutions for all
units and all optional projects are done), you want to add a "parse a
date" TIF. --MF, 5/23/20

::: learn
**On this page,** you will develop an abstract data type
(ADT) to store and access <em>dates</em>, and you will adapt your
contact ADT to use it to store each contact's birthday.<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-birthdate.png" title="contact with name: ... birthday: (date (July) (9) (2005))" alt="contact with name: ... birthday: (date (July) (9) (2005))" class="ms-4"/>

::: takeNote
As we add more complexity to contacts---birthday, work address, and
so on---the location of each data point (such as the phone number)
inside a contact might change. This is where an abstract data type
helps. If you were to move the phone number as you refine your contact
ADT, you <em>could</em> fix every single block that uses the phone
number, or if you have an ADT, you could just fix the one
<em>selector</em> that chooses the phone number from the list. With that
one change, all the other blocks using that selector will get the data
they need automatically.

Notice that name, address, and text are strings, but birthdate is a
list. You can combine elements of different types in a list.

::: {#first .forYouToDo}
<ol>

<li>

Create an ADT to manage three data points for each date:
<var>month</var>, <var>day</var>, and <var>year</var>.

<ol>

<li>Create a `date` <em>constructor</em> that accepts this
data as input and then reports a date as a list of three items. <br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/date-constructor-reporting.png" title="date (July) (9) (2005) reporting {July, 9, 2005}" alt="date (July) (9) (2005) reporting {July, 9, 2005}" class="ms-4"/></li>

<li>Write three <em>selector</em> blocks to retrieve the specific data
(month, day, or year) from the inputted date. <br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/date-constructor-in-month-selector-reporting.png" title="month from date: () reporting July" alt="month from date: () reporting July" class="ms-4"/>
<img src="/img/3-lists/date-constructor-in-day-selector-reporting.png" title="day from date: () reporting 9" alt="day from date: () reporting 9" class="ms-4"/>
<img src="/img/3-lists/date-constructor-in-year-selector-reporting.png" title="year from date: () reporting 2005" alt="year from date: () reporting 2005" class="ms-4"/></li>

<li>**Debug** any problems with the constructor or
selectors.</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>

Integrate your `date` ADT into the `contact` ADT.

<ul>

<li>Edit the `contact` constructor block definition to accept
a birthdate as a list by using the `date` constructor. <br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-date-reporting.png" title="contact with name: (Betsy) address: (123 Main St., New York NY 10001) phone: (212-555-1234) birthdate: (date (July) (9) (2005)) reporting {Betsy, 123 Main St., New York NY 10001, 212-555-1234, {July, 9, 2005}}" alt="contact with name: (Betsy) address: (123 Main St., New York NY 10001) phone: (212-555-1234) birthdate: (date (July) (9) (2005)) reporting {Betsy, 123 Main St., New York NY 10001, 212-555-1234, {July, 9, 2005}}" class="ms-4"/></li>

<li>Create a `birthdate from contact` <em>selector</em> to
retrieve the contact birthdate from the inputted contact.<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/birthdate-from-contact-reporting.png" title="birthdate from contact: (contact with name: (Betsy) address: (123 Main St., New York NY 10001) phone: (212-555-1234) birthdate: (date (July) (9) (2005))) reporting {July, 9, 2005}" alt="birthdate from contact: (contact with name: (Betsy) address: (123 Main St., New York NY 10001) phone: (212-555-1234) birthdate: (date (July) (9) (2005))) reporting {July, 9, 2005}" class="ms-4"/></li>

<li>

Adapt your "Add Contact" button to input this new type of contact into
your list.

<h4>**Adding Contacts with Birthdays**</h4>

You could use several ask and answer blocks together with script
variables.



Another way is to use <em>abstraction</em> and create another helper,
<img src="/img/3-lists/ask-birthdate.png" title="ask birthdate" alt="ask birthdate" class="inlinde"/>
that reports a list of the user's answers to these prompts:

<ul>

<li>What is the contact's birth month?</li>

<li>What is the contact's birth day?</li>

<li>What is the contact's birth year?</li>

</ul>

<img src="/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-date-with-helpers.png" title="contact with name: (ask name) address: (ask address) phone: (ask phone) birthdate: (ask birthdate)" alt="contact with name: (ask name) address: (ask address) phone: (ask phone) birthdate: (ask birthdate)" class="ms-4"/>

</ul>

</li>

<img src="/img/icons/save-mini.png" title="Save Your Work" alt="Save Your Work" class="float-end"/>

<li>**Debug.** Clear your `contact list`, and
add a new few contacts with birthdays. Fix any problems.</li>
