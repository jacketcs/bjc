<p>I made some edits to include the word "possible" more. I'm not sure I
didn't make it more confusing. Need to look again another day. --MF,
6/13/18</p>

<p>I need to review the rest of this lab. Looks different than before.
--MF, 5/31/20</p>

<p>PG: I haven't thought deeply (haven't even read carefully!) but would
want to check carefully to make sure this is /developmentally/ helpful.
Maybe it already is.</p>

<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll program your Tic-Tac-Toe
project first to report the contents of one specific set of three
squares that would make a win (such as the top row), and then to use
that to find the contents of all possible winning triples. You'll use
that information to find out if one of the players has won the game.</p>

<h3>Checking One Way to Win</h3>

<p>We need a way to find out if a possible winning triple has actually
happened. We can use <code>map</code> to check each position in one
triple to see if either player has won with that triple.</p>

::: endnote
<p>You learned about <code>map</code> in
<a href="/unit-3/lab-2/5-mapping-over-list.html" title="Unit 3 Lab 2 Page 5: Transforming Every List Item">Unit
3 Lab 2 Page 5: Transforming Every List Item</a>.</p>

<p><code>Map</code> applies the function in the gray ring to each item
in the input list, and it reports a list of all the results.<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/map-example-2.png" title="map (join( )(s)) over (list {cat, dog, bird}) reporting {cats, dogs, birds}" alt="map (join( )(s)) over (list {cat, dog, bird}) reporting {cats, dogs, birds}" class="ms-4"/></p>

<p>Recall that the blank input slot in the function inside the gray ring
is where one list item goes every time the function is performed.</p>

to start a new game. Play one game, <em>deliberately letting
<strong>x</strong> win</em>.</li>

<li>

Then build this expression, and see what it reports:<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/map-item-board.png" title="map (item ( ) of (board)) over (list{1, 2, 3})" alt="map (item ( ) of (board)) over (list{1, 2, 3})" class="ms-4"/><br />

<a href="#hint-map-item" data-bs-toggle="collapse" title="How does map work here?">How
does <code>map</code> work here?</a>

::: {#hint-map-item .collapse}
<p>This <code>map</code> expression works the same way as the
<code>join</code> example above, but people sometimes find it a little
more complex to think about, because it's natural to expect
<img src="/img/3-lists/map-over-board.png" title="map (something) over (board)" alt="map (something) over (board)"/>,
but that's <em>not</em> what the expression says. Instead, it maps over
a <em>constant</em> list, not a variable. As before, <code>map</code>
inserts each list item into the blank space in the function inside the
gray ring, and it reports a list of the results.</p>

<p>But here, the function in the gray ring is <code>item ( ) of
(</code><var>board</var><code>)</code>, so <code>map</code> checks items
1, 2, and 3 of the <var>board</var> list, and it reports a list of what
is in those three positions (each of which is X, O, or a number if the
square is empty).</p>

<p>If you can't see what's inside the <var>board</var> variable, be sure
its box is checked in the Variables palette and expand its watcher to
see its list items as in the picture below.<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/ttt-board-var.png" title="picture of: watcher of board variable showing {O, O, X, 4, X, 6, X, 8, 9}; and Tic Tac Toe game with X, X, O in top row; empty, X, empty in middle row; and X, empty, empty in bottom row" alt="picture of: watcher of board variable showing {O, O, X, 4, X, 6, X, 8, 9}; and Tic Tac Toe game with X, X, O in top row; empty, X, empty in middle row; and X, empty, empty in bottom row" class="ms-4 noshadow"/>

What does the result of that expression tell you about the state of the
game?</li>

<li>If <code>{1, 2, 3}</code> isn't the triple in which
<strong>x</strong> won the game, replace the list in the
<code>map</code> expression with the winning triple, and click the
expression again.</li>

<li>

Use this idea to make a
<img src="/img/3-lists/status-of-triple.png" title="status of triple ( )" alt="status of triple ( )"/>
block that takes one possible winning triple (a triple like
<img src="/img/3-lists/{1,2,3}.png" title="list{1, 2, 3}" alt="list{1, 2, 3}"/>)
as input and reports a list of what is in those three positions (X, O,
or a number). Then use it to write an expression in the scripting area
whose value will be <code>True</code> if X won the game <em>in the
triple
<img src="/img/3-lists/{1,2,3}.png" title="list{1, 2, 3}" alt="list{1, 2, 3}"/>,</em>
or <code>False</code> otherwise.

<h3>Checking All the Ways to Win</h3>

<p>Now you're going to use <code>status of triple</code> systematically
to check <em>all</em> the triples.</p>

<p>For example, Player O has won the game below, and the <code>status of
all winning triples</code> block finds the status of each possible
triple. The computer can use this block to check for a winning triple
that has either all X or all O.<br />
<img src="/img/3-lists/status-of-all-board.png" title="Tic Tac Toe game where Player O has won down the middle column. In row one, there is X, O, and X. In row two, there is X, O, and an empty square. In row three, there is an empty square, O, and an empty square." alt="Tic Tac Toe game where Player O has won down the middle column. In row one, there is X, O, and X. In row two, there is X, O, and an empty square. In row three, there is an empty square, O, and an empty square." class="ms-4 noshadow"/>
<img src="/img/3-lists/status-of-all-reporting.png" title="The status of all winning triples block is reporting a list of lists (a table). There are three columns and eight rows, and each cell contains either a X, an O, or a number. There is text to the right of each row listing the corresponding triple and where it appears on the board (such as 1, 5, 9 being the top-left to bottom-right diagonal). The triple in which Player O has won this game (2, 5, 8) shows O, O, O in the table. That is the only row with either all O or all X." alt="The status of all winning triples block is reporting a list of lists (a table).

The order of your triples and/or the numbering of the positions in your
project might be different. This is OK as long as your project works.

::: forYouToDo
<ol start="7">

<li>Use <code>map</code> together with some of the other blocks you have
made to build the <code>status of all winning triples</code> block. It
should report the status of all of the possible winning triples as a
list of lists, as shown above.</li>

<p>

When you use <code>map</code> think:

<ol>

<li>What is the function you are performing? That goes in the gray
ring.</li>

<li>What data are you performing that function on? That is the list you
are mapping over.</li>

</ol>

Here, you want to know the status of each possible winning triple.
