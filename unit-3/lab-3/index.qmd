**In this lab,** you will continue your Tic-Tac-Toe project to make the program analyze the game board to detect wins and ties.

Start by opening up your tic tac toe project from Unit 3 Lab 1 Page 5. If you don't have it or your project has issues, you may ask your teacher for a solution file to work with instead.
