**JK: I don't have a place for this note from Brian**: I'd
like to say something, if we can make it understandable, about the way
non-physical products (software, movies, etc.) distort the market for
physical stuff (especially housing). People get rich on ideas, but you
can't eat ideas, and the supply of real stuff isn't infinitely
expandable, so in effect real stuff becomes more expensive for people
not in the virtual-stuff business.

**On this page,** you will discuss how technology has
changed jobs and how it may affect what jobs are available in the
future.

Until recently, many economists argued that jobs lost through
automation would be replaced by new jobs controlling the machinery.
Recent research has established that the number of new
technology-control jobs is too small to make up for the jobs replaced by
the technology. There <em>are</em> new jobs available, but they're not
as good as the old ones; they are some or all of part-time, low-pay,
short-term, or without benefits such as health insurance.
