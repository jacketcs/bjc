Artificial Intelligence is a very active field with many interesting
developments announced daily. Choose a topic you're interested in (like
medicine, finance, politics, education, communication, law, gaming,
astronomy, psychology, transportation, literature, international policy,
etc.) and find 2-3 recent news articles that relate to developments in
AI in that field. Be prepared to share what you find with the class.

<ul>

<li>In addition to reporting new developments, mention challenges for AI
that still remain.</li>

</ul>
