**In this project,** you will use abstraction to draw a
brick wall.

<h3>Drawing One Brick</h3>



A picture of a brick is just a rectangle with a brick red color.
However, there's no `draw rectangle` block in Snap<em>!</em>.
One way to draw one is by thinking of a rectangle as a very thick line.
Here's the idea:<br />

::: sidenoteBig
Any good programming language might have many tools for drawing and
moving, but it wouldn't make sense to have special tools for drawing
bricks because most programs don't involve bricks. That's the sort of
tool you make yourself when you need it.

Ordinarily, Snap<em>!</em> draws rounded ends on thick lines:
<img src="/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/round-ends.png" title="line with round ends" alt="line with round ends" class="py-0"/>.
That's often the best choice, and you can see why below. But for bricks,
we want <em>flat</em> line ends:
<img src="/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/flat-ends.png" title="flat line ends" alt="flat line ends" class="py-0"/>,
and so we'll use
<img src="/img/blocks/set-flat-line-ends.png" title="set (flat line ends) to &apos;predicate input slot&apos;" alt="set (flat line ends) to &apos;predicate input slot&apos;"/>
to turn on flat line ends.

As you learned in
<a href="/unit-1/lab-2/2-gossip.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 2: Making Programs Talk">Unit
1 Lab 2 Page 2: Making Programs Talk</a>, **procedural
abstraction** is the process of developing a program by breaking
up a large problem into smaller sub-problems.

Creating a `draw brick` block lets you think in terms of a
procedure with a name related to the problem you are solving. This makes
your code easier to read, and once you've coded and debugged the block,
you don't need to think about how it works each time you use it. That's
the beauty of procedural abstraction.
:::

<h3>Using Modularity</h3>

You'd like the "top level" block to be something like this:<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/draw-brick-wall-7.png" title="draw brick wall, rows: (7)" alt="draw brick wall, rows: (7)" class="ms-4"/><br />
Getting there involves <em>modularity</em>.

**Modularity** is the process of breaking a problem into

There are two kinds of rows, so you'll make blocks that specialize in
each:

<ul>

<li>**Row A**:
<img src="/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-a.png" title="Row A" alt="Row A" class="noshadow" border="0"/></li>

<li>**Row B**:

much abstraction?</a>

::: {#hint-too-much .collapse}
It's possible to go overboard on abstraction and build so many blocks
that your program is just as cluttered as it would be without the custom
blocks. But it <em>can</em> be useful to make a custom block even when
its definition is just one built-in block. For example, to draw the
mortar between blocks (the white gaps), you can just use `move (4)
steps`, but it might make sense to define a `draw
mortar` block that uses `move` inside it.

Why? You might later decide that four steps is the wrong thickness
for mortar and you'd rather have five. Or you might want the mortar to
be mortar-colored, slightly gray. With many `move (4) steps`
instructions scattered through your program, you would have to find and
change each one. To make matters worse, your complete project might have
`move` blocks that <em>aren't</em> about mortar. But with a
`draw mortar` block, you can change just its definition, and
all the mortar in your picture will be changed.

The two kinds of rows should be exactly the same length. Your first try
at drawing Row B is probably a little too long. **If so, debug
it.**

Add these extra inputs one at a time, not all at once! When you modify
the length of a brick, that should also change the length of an end
brick for row B. When you modify the gap thickness, that should also
change the distance between the rows.
