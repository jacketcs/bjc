<p>Grace Hopper (1906-1992) was an United States Navy rear admiral and
pioneer of computer programming. She is best known for her trailblazing
contributions to computer programming, software development, and the
design and implementation of programming languages.</p>

Minutes: Grace Hopper</a></p>

<p>One early case of "debugging" was when an actual moth got stuck
inside a computer Grace Hopper was working with in 1947. Here is a page
from her notebook with the moth pasted in.</p>

<li><strong>Try to write elegant code.</strong> If you're writing a
state capitals quiz, then you'll need to store every state and capital
in your program, but if you're writing a multiplication quiz you can
have the computer calculate the answers. Take advantage of the natural
structure of the problem you are solving.</li>

<strong>Use abstraction</strong> to hide complexity. Isolate some
details into a custom block, and get that working right. Then use that
abstraction just as if it were built into Snap<em>!</em>. Abstraction
allows you to build and test pieces of your code one at a time; it makes
your code more readable. If you can't see an entire script on your
screen at once, it's time to stop and organize your code.

</li>

<li><strong>Don't delete your project and start over.</strong> This
sounds obvious when you see it written down, but programming students
sometimes get angry at their bugs. Remember that if you have a program
with 20 blocks in it, and one of the 20 has an error, then your program
is 95% correct.</li>

<li>

How to find a bug:

<ul>

<li><strong>Reproduce the problem</strong> so you are sure you know how
to recreate it. This will help you know when you've fixed it.</li>

<li><strong>Isolate the piece of code producing the error.</strong> Test
pieces of your code separately so you know what's working and what
isn't.</li>

<li><strong>Identify the specific cause of the error</strong> within
that code. <em>Why</em> is that code doing the wrong thing?</li>

<li><strong>Always test your code with different inputs.</strong> Look
for extreme cases: What if the input is really big, zero, negative, or a
decimal? What if the user types something you aren't expecting? What if
the user clicks somewhere else?</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Don't add code to work around a bug.</strong> In fact, don't
edit buggy code at all (except to add temporary debugging code) until
you understand the problem; then <em>remove</em> the error. Think:
"Debug by subtraction, not by addition."</li>

<li><strong>Don't be hard on yourself.</strong> <em>Everyone</em> gets
bugs in their programs; it's part of programming.</li>

<li><strong>If it works, it's correct.</strong> You don't need to ask
your teacher "Is this right?" The computer will tell you whether your
solution is correct, and more than one solution may work.</li>

<li><strong>Be open to new ideas.</strong> Especially if you learned to
program before this course, a few of the ideas in this course might seem
strange to you, such as the use of higher-order functions instead of
looping. One of the goals of BJC is to introduce you to different ways
of organizing a program that make the code shorter and don't have as
many openings for bugs to creep in.</li>

<li><strong>Love your bugs!</strong> They pose an interesting puzzle.
Sometimes their incorrect behavior suggests another project:<br />

Ways to show the values of variables and sprite attributes:

<ul>

<li><strong>Clicking a reporter</strong> will show the value of a
variable or sprite attribute.</li>

<li><strong>Checking the box next to a variable in the palette</strong>
(<img src="/img/2-complexity/var-check.png" alt="Variable with check-box checked" class="inline" width="82"/>)
will also show the value of that variable or sprite attribute.</li>

<li><strong><img src="/img/blocks/show-variable.png" title="show variable" alt="show variable"/></strong>
lets you do the equivalent of checking the box for script variables,
which aren't in the palette.

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Comments</strong> let you document your program.</li>

<li>The <strong>"Unused blocks..."</strong> option in the Snap<em>!</em>
File menu will eliminate blocks you no longer need. This is often useful
when you've loaded a library but you only need one or two blocks from
the library.</li>

<li>The <strong>"clean up" option</strong> in the right-click (or
control-click on a Mac) menu of the scripting area background will
reposition scripts on the page so they don't overlap.</li>

<li>

::: ap-standard
AAP-1.A.2
:::

<strong>Snap<em>!</em> lets you use more than one word in the name of a
block or variable</strong>. Some programmers try to save time by naming
all their variables <var>x</var>, but if they forget and call a
<em>second</em> variable <var>x</var>, this can lead to bugs. To make
your programs easier to understand and debug, you can use meaningful
names, such as <var>horizontal position</var>, instead.
