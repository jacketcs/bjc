data and your computer.

It should not be the responsibility of the individual to ensure their
safety online just as it's not their responsibility to do a safety
inspection of every subway car before boarding. Without proper
regulation, there are no perfect solutions that you as an individual can
use to be sure you will never be victimized. However, there are things
you can do that will help:

helped lead from a 3 person start up, to a world-wide leader in
cybersecurity, specializing in tools that detect network security and
compliance issues. Whiting serves on multiple boards focused on
increasing diversity in Cyber Security with the aim of reducing
group-think and accelerating innovation & organizational resilience.

can thrive - through building "inclusion by design" into workplace
culture, policy and practice.

<li>**Run up-to-date software.** The Windows 98 operating
system was not sold after 2000, and not supported after 2006. But there
are <em>still</em> computers running this obsolete system, including
many in the US Department of
Defense.<a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-95-98-pentagon/" target="_blank">\[source\]</a>
Usually, when people keep using obsolete systems, it's because they rely
on application software that runs only in the old system.</li>

<li>

Use authentication to protect devices and information from unauthorized
access. For example:

<ol>

<li>**Use strong passwords.** You need a separate password
for every site you use. The only good solution is to use a <em>password
manager,</em> a program that makes up a random password for every site.
You just remember one password, the one for the password manager itself.
It takes care of your other ones for you.</li>

<li>**Enable multifactor authentication** (such as
two-factor authentication) so you can only access your device or account
after entering specific information (typically one is a password and the
other requires another of your devices or accounts or the other uses
something that detects your body like a fingerprint reader). It may feel
like a hassle, but each step added to the login progress adds another
layer of security.</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>**Don't click links** on websites or especially in
email, **without first double-checking** that the actual
URL in the link is what you expect. (Where does this link to
<a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">http://google.com</a>
really send you?) If a computer or account of someone you know has been
compromised, you may receive emails appearing to come from them that
contain malicious links that could compromise your system or account. As
you know, it's important to keep your software up-to-date, but a common
trick is a pop up window asking you to download an update. Don't click
those unless you're sure it really is a legitimate update. It's best to
go to the "updates" section of the app or operating system for
updates.</li>

<li>**Don't use sketchy software. **If the advertising says
that the program will get you money, free stuff, pornography, or cheats
for video games, it's very likely to be malware. A particularly sneaky
category is fake antivirus software! Check the reviews in magazines (and
double-check the link you plan to download from) in order to make sure
you're getting what you really want.</li>

<li>**Regularly review your security settings** for the
websites, apps, and programs you use. You can control the permissions
for collecting and sharing your information.</li>

<li>**Install Antivirus and anti-malware software.** There
are free versions of several popular packages available. Read reviews to
find software that will match your needs and budget.</li>

<li>**Don't connect to insecure WiFi.** Ideally, WiFi
networks should use WPA2 or WPA3 (WiFi Protected Access) security, but
WPA is better than no security at all.</li>
