SO MUCH TEXT. Paul, can you suggest any cuts? --MF, 8/5/19

::: learn
<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about threats to online
security.</p>
:::

<p>Originally, network security was a relatively minor consideration
because the Arpanet was a small computer network of military personnel
and university users. The real need for security arose once businesses
were allowed on the Internet in 1995. These days, people give their
credit card numbers to online shopping sites, do much of their banking
online, and send their social security numbers to tax firms and credit
bureaus. And computers controlling critical social infrastructure (such
as power plants, telephone switching systems, traffic lights, and
hospital equipment) can be attacked by criminals and other countries'
militaries.</p>

<h3>Common Security Issues for Users</h3>

::: ap-standard
design flaws: IOC-2.B.10, anti-virus and anti-malware: IOC-2.C.7,
phishing: IOC-2.C.1
:::

::: vocabBig
::: ap-standard
malware: IOC-2.B.9, keylogging: IOC-2.C.2, virus: IOC-2.B.8, antivirus
or anti-malware software: IOC-2.B.7, phishing: IOC-2.C.1
:::

<ul>

<li><strong>Malware</strong> is software that was designed to harm or
take partial control over your computer.</li>

<li><strong>Keylogging software</strong> is a kind of malware that
records every key pressed by a user.</li>

<li>A <strong>computer virus</strong> is a type of malware that spreads
and infects other computers. Viruses can attach themselves to legitimate
programs.</li>

<li><strong>Antivirus or anti-malware software</strong> is software
designed to scan your files and Internet transmissions looking for
malware.</li>

<li>A <strong>firewall</strong> is a security system that controls the
kinds of connections that can be made between a computer or network and
the outside world.</li>

<li><strong>Phishing</strong> is a common security attack in which the
victim is tricked into giving up personal information or downloading
malware.</li>

</ul>
:::

<p>Software has <em>bugs</em> (even published software written by
professionals). And people can use those bugs for bad purposes (such as
crashing your computer or implanting <em>keylogging software</em> to
collect everything you type, including passwords and other confidential
information). Software developers try to prevent security bugs and fix
them when they turn up, but not every software developer distributes
fixes promptly. (And not every computer user keeps up with software
updates perfectly!)</p>

<p>The general name for programs that try to affect your computer badly
is <em>malware</em>. You computer can end up with malware if you or
someone using your computer downloads untrustworthy software (such as
from freeware or shareware sites; not everything on those sites is bad,
but if you aren't careful, you might install something that is).</p>

<p>One kind of malware is called a <em>virus</em>. Computer viruses make
copies of themselves (just as biological viruses do) and try to spread
themselves over the network to other computers. People use <em>antivirus
software</em> to help prevent these attacks. People also use
<em>firewalls</em> to limit connections into or out of their computer.
(Both your computer and your router probably run firewall software.)</p>

<p>Another common attack strategy is called <em>phishing:</em> an
attacker sends you an email that appears to be from some official
organization (such as your bank) and tricks you into giving information
to the attackers (such as your bank password). The attacker can then use
your personal information to gain access to sensitive online resources,
such as your bank accounts or emails.</p>

<h3>Common Security Issues with Public Systems</h3>

<p>A Denial of Service (DoS) attack consists of sending a lot of
requests to a server at the same time (for instance, requests for a web
page or some data). This can overload the server's network bandwidth. A
DoS attack doesn't destroy data or collect passwords; it just causes a
temporary inability to reach the targeted server so other users of that
server are denied service.</p>

::: vocabBig
<p>A <strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack</strong> uses a
virus to flood a server with many requests from many computers at once
so that users of that server are denied service.</p>
:::

<p>A variant is the <em>Distributed Denial of Service</em> (DDoS)
attack, in which the attacker first uses viruses and other malware to
take control of many (sometimes hundreds of thousands of) computers
around the world. This network of infected computers is called a
<em>botnet</em>. The attacker then launches a DoS attack from all of the
victims' computers at the same time. Besides increasing the number of
simultaneous server requests, DDoS makes it harder to determine who is
at fault, since the attack seems to come from many innocent people.</p>

::: ap-standard
rogue access point: IOC-2.C.3, IOC-2.C.4
:::

<p>Unless your data is encrypted, it can be read or modified as it's
being sent over public networks. One way that this can happen is through
a <em>rogue access point</em>.</p>

::: vocabFullWidth
:

<p>A <strong>rogue accessÂ point</strong> is a wireless access point that
gives access to a secure network without the authorization of the
network administrator.</p>
:::

<p>A rogue access point may be installed by someone trying to improve
access to the network or by an attacker. But either way, the lack of
proper security can allow data being sent over that WiFi network to be
intercepted. For example, if your computer has password access to a WiFi
network, and you enable Bluetooth network sharing, you are allowing
anyone in Bluetooth range of your computer access to the secure
network.</p>

<h3>Is Too Much Security Possible?</h3>

<p>Too much security has its own set of problems. A perfectly secure
Internet would prevent anonymous publishing, restricting freedom of
speech. To prevent fraud, it's important to be able to verify the source
of a message, but if the source of a message can be verified, the
message can't be anonymous. That's problematic both for privacy and for
freedom of speech.</p>
