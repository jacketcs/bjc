<li>

The **Internet** is a <em>computer network</em> that uses
open protocols to standardize communication. A <em>computing device</em>
connected to an Internet-connected device is required to access the
Internet.

<ul>



<li>A **computer <em>network</em>** is an interconnected
<em>computing system</em> that is capable of sending or receiving
data.</li>

<li>A **computing <em>system</em>** is a group of
<em>computing devices</em> and programs working together for a common
purpose.</li>

<li>A **computing <em>device</em>** is a physical object
that can run a program, such as computers, tablets, cell phones, and
smart sensors.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The **World Wide Web** is a system of linked pages,
programs, and files that uses the Internet.</li>

</ul>
:::

People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" are the
same thing, but they are not. The <em>Internet</em> is a network of
independent but connected computing devices spread out all over the
world. The <em>World Wide Web</em> is the collection of interlinked
website documents that you can view with a web browser by typing an
address like
<a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html" target="_blank" title="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html">https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html</a>.
Most web pages are written with HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and
interpreted by your browser using HTTP (HyperText Transfer
Protocol).

The Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also
supports email, mobile apps, texting (SMS or Short Message Service),
file transfers, and many other ways that computers communicate.

The World Wide Web has grown far beyond its original purpose, which
was rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific
community. The expansion of the Web to include things like online
shopping and personal blogs was an <em>unintended consequence</em> of
the technology.

<h3>How Does the Internet Work?</h3>



The Internet is a massive network of computers that facilitate
communication around the globe. It works because it's engineered to be
fault-tolerant (capable of working even if some of the network breaks
down) and uses protocols (a type of abstraction) for routing and
transmitting data:

<ul>

<li>The Internet is fault-tolerant because it is a **redundant
network**. There are <em>multiple pathways</em> among its
physical connections to create <em>redundancy</em>. Even if one pathway
is unavailable, there is still another way to transmit a message from
sender to receiver (as shown right). Software in the connection points
knows how to re-route data if one connection fails.</li>

<li>Data is transmitted via **open protocols**. Protocols
<em>standardize</em> communication, so all data is sent by the same
rules for sending and receiving the data. These protocols are
<em>open</em> (available for use by anyone) to ensure that anyone can
build systems that connect to the Internet.</li>

</ul>



The Internet isn't just a network of computers, though. It's a
<em>network of networks</em>. The connection points between networks are
called **routers**, networking devices that route traffic
between subnetworks on the Internet. Making sense of the information
happens at the destination computer.

<ul>

<li>A **router** is a computer that passes information from
one network to another.</li>

Your computer probably uses a router that is somewhere in your home
to connect to your <em>ISP</em>.

<li>**ISPs** (Internet Service Providers) are the companies
who sell Internet access to homes and institutions.</li>

The computers connected to the Internet and the connections among
them don't belong to any one organization. Different ISPs provide the
Internet to different communities. And typically within a large
organization (such as a university), the Internet connections are
provided by the organization itself.

<h3>What Is the Cloud?</h3>

::: vocabBig
<ul>



<li>**Bandwidth** is the maximum amount of data that can be
sent in a fixed amount of time (for digital data, it is measured in bits
per second). Higher bandwidth is better because the data will travel
more quickly.</li>

<li>Storing data in **the cloud** means storing it
<em>somewhere</em> on the Internet, but you don't know where. The cloud
service provider (Google, Dropbox, Amazon, Snap<em>!</em>, etc.) manages
the actual storage location.</li>

</ul>
:::

In the early days of the Internet, <em>bandwidth</em> was slow, so
people couldn't send video (only text and small pictures). Back then,
computers were huge and expensive, so people went to a computer center
to do their computations. As the technology became smaller and more
efficient, however, these centers became less important because people
could do computations on personal computing devices.

More recently, though, certain kinds of computation (such as web
searches and voice recognition) require more computational power, and
these tasks are instead sent to huge "computer farms" where tens of
thousands of computers work together on a problem. These computer farms,
all together, are referred to as <em>the cloud</em>. You have been using
the cloud throughout this course: all of your Snap<em>!</em> projects
are stored in the cloud. You still use computer at your desk, but some
of the programs actually run on the cloud.

::: endnote
When you save your Snap<em>!</em> projects to your account, they aren't
stored on your local computer but on the cloud; that's why you have to
log in to access them. Similarly, if you use Google Drive or Dropbox,
all of those files are stored in the cloud. And if you use a web-based
email service (such as Gmail or Yahoo), your emails are stored in the
cloud too.
