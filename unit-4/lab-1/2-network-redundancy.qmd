**On this page,** you will learn how the layout of the
Internet is redundant (more than one path from here to there) in order
to ensure reliability.

Thomas (David) Petite (born 1956) is a member of the Fond du Lac Band
of the Lake Superior Chippewa tribe. David is best known for his work on
wireless enabled devices. He is one of the early inventors of the
wireless ad hoc networks, a temporary decentralized type of wireless
network that enables all mobile phones to work today. His inventions
were also a driving force behind the development of what is now known as
the "Smart Grid" which monitors and harnesses the power of
wireless-enabled devices at a specific location.

Given the enormous number of devices on the Internet and the reality
that pieces of a complex system fail at unexpected times (and often in
groups of neighbors such as a whole city), the Internet had to be
designed to be <em>reliable</em>. This is achieved by building many
<em>redundant</em> connections into the physical systems of the
Internet. That way, if part of the Internet fails, data can be re-routed
via a different <em>path</em>. And such changes to the path can happen
in transit because <em>routing</em> on the Internet is dynamic; it is
not specified in advance. Creating such redundancy can require
additional resources (such as additional computers and cables) but it
also increases the Internet's <em>fault tolerance</em> (ability to work
around problems) and helps the Internet <em>scale</em> (expand) to more
devices and people.

In the animation, a lightening bolt strikes one of the nodes. There
are many reasons a node can fail, such as power failure, chip burnout,
etc. The other thing that can happen is that the nodes can all be fine,
but the green lines linking the nodes, which represent connections,
could fail (e.g., a cable could be cut or disconnected, either
accidentally or on purpose).

In this model of a network, what is the <em>minimum</em> number of nodes
(connection points) that can stop working before the sender and the
receiver can't communicate? (Other than the sender or the receiver
themselves, of course.)

There are no nodes that are vital to the system. Pick any node to stop
working, and you can still find another path.

Correct! If the node with six connections goes down and also either of
the two to its left, the sender and receiver can't communicate.

Try to find a smaller number of nodes that can stop working and still

In the same model network, what is the <em>maximum</em> number of nodes
that can fail and still let Sender and Receiver communicate?
