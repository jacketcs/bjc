In case someone wants to do more with the project one day:

<ul>

<li>The color version of the project
(<a class="run" href="/prog/6-computers/U6L1-TranslatingBinary_color.xml" target="_blank">U6L1-TranslatingBinary_color.xml</a>)
breaks Snap<em>!</em> because of an unresolved bug
(<a href="https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/issues/1873" target="_blank">#1873</a>).</li>

<li>The PHP script that I used to get the binary sequences for images is
here:
<a href="/utilities/colorreader.php" target="_blank">/utilities/colorreader.php</a>.
Edit the \$im variable initialization (currently line 9) to change the
path of the color file exported into a binary sequence, and edit the
\$imbw initialization (currently line 59) to change the B&W file. It
would be amazing to incorporate this into the project, but that would
require being able to handle uploaded images or images with an existing
URL, and I haven't thought through that possibility yet. --MF,

**On this page,** you will learn more about how
information is represented inside the computer as sequences of bits.
:::

::: sidenote
In many programming languages there's a convention that every text
string ends with a <em>null</em> byte, in which all eight bits are zero,
a code that's reserved for this purpose. So our
"`Welcome...`" string might actually occupy 44 bytes.
:::

So far we've been working with small chunks of data, from Boolean
values (one bit) to characters (eight bits). But of course some
information in your computer or smartphone is much bigger than that. For
starters, characters aren't generally used one at a time; they're used
in <em>text strings</em> such as "`Welcome to the Beauty and Joy of
Computing.`" These 43 characters occupy 43 bytes of computer
memory. But the real champion users of space are media files: pictures,
sounds (mostly music), and video.

If we could see inside the memory's bits, a section of the memory
might look something like this:

> <code >01000001001000000111001101101101011000010111001001110100001000000111000001101000011011110110111001100101001011000010000001101100011010010110101101100101001000000111100101101111011101010111001000100000011011000110000101110000011101000110111101110000001000000110111101110010001000000110010001100101011100110110101101110100011011110111000000100000011000110110111101101101011100000111010101110100011001010111001000101100001000000110001101100001011011100 `


::: vocab
A **binary sequence** (also called a <em>bitstream</em>)
is a string of ones and zeros.
:::

That shows just 449 bits. A 16GB cell phone has 16 gigabytes (about
16 billion bytes) of storage with each byte containing 8 bits. That's
128,000,000,000 bits. Printed on paper as ones and zeros, the 16GB
phone's memory would take nearly 40,000,000 pages. The information in
storage---whether it is a text message, a photograph, a song, a computer
program, or a list of phone numbers---all looks the same, like a
sequence of bits that are either On or Off (one or zero), a <em>binary
sequence</em>.

As we write this in 2017, it's common to have a terabyte disk drive
on your desk. Web services deal with petabytes or exabytes of data.

When we write big numbers, we put commas every three digits (counting
from the right). Each group of three has a name: thousand, million,
billion, and so on. So, the number 1,234,567,890 is pronounced "one
billion, 234 million, 567 thousand, 890." Those group names ("thousand"
and so on) also have prefix names used in metric measurements:

"Binary sequence" is a very broad category, and often, several layers
of abstraction are built on it. For example, you can include a picture
in an email or text message, in which case, the <em>message</em>
includes a <em>picture</em>, which is a kind of <em>file</em>, which is
a kind of <em>binary sequence</em>.

Brian has more or less convinced Mary to change the block names from
"convert decimal to binary" to "convert number to binary" and vice versa
AND they both agreed to drop the recursion inside the `convert
number to binary` block. The starter project, solutions, and

changes are needed on the Binary Representation page. --MF, 6/5/20

The quotes tell Snap<em>!</em> that the binary sequence should be saved
"as is." Without some text at the beginning, Snap<em>!</em> will think
your binary sequence is a number, and it would remove any zeros at the
front, which would change the interpretation of where each byte begins
and ends.

<li>Find the `set (`<var>output</var>`) to...`
instruction and **change the input text** to a short text
string of your choosing. The reported binary sequence will be stored in
the <var>output</var> variable with quotes around it.<br />

**Analog** data have values that change smoothly, unlike
digital data which change in discrete intervals.

**Sampling** means measuring values, called
**samples**, of an analog signal at regular intervals.

The **sampling rate** is the number of samples measured
per second.
:::

Not all data are naturally digital. (That is, they may not be
individual values that can be represented in the form of binary
sequences.) Some real-world values (such as the pitch and volume of
music, the colors of a painting, or the position of a sprinter during a
race) change smoothly over time or position; they are <em>analog</em>.
When analog data are encoded digitally (as bits on a computer), their
values are approximated. This is an example of abstraction. The
continuously changing air pressure of a sound, for example, is
<em>sampled</em> (measured) thousands of times a second, and the samples
are stored as bits.

A text is a finite number of characters, each of which comes from a
finite alphabet. So a book without pictures is naturally digital. When a
piece of music is written down, there are a finite number of possible
notes, so there's a finite "alphabet" of symbols such as ♫ or 𝄢, and the
piece of music uses only finitely many of them. So the <em>score,</em>
the written notation for the music, is naturally digital. But the actual
sound of words being read or music being played includes much more
information (such as they way someone says the words, their accent, or
the way each instrument sounds). So speech and musical performance are
<em>not</em> naturally digital.

So if pictures, music, and words all look the same in memory---all
binary sequences---how can the computer tell what any chunk of memory
actually is? For example, should the sequence 01000001 be interpreted as
the number 65, the letter A, a rather dark shade of red, or something
else?

The meaning of a sequence of bits depends on the context in which it
is used. What exactly do we mean by "context"? How does a programming
language know whether to interpret a bit sequence as an integer, a
picture, a string of characters, an instruction, or something else?
There's always <em>another</em> bit sequence somewhere that encodes the
**data type** of the bit sequence.

But different languages use data types differently. In high-level
languages, that data type code is attached to <em>the value itself.</em>
In lower-level languages, when you make a variable, you have to say what
type of value it will contain, and the data type is attached to the
<em>variable</em>, so you can't get exact answers when the values are
integers and <em>also</em> be able to handle non-integer values of the
same variable. So instead of seeing <br />
<img src="/img/4-internet/varfoo.png" title="script variables (foo)" alt="script variables (foo)" class="ms-4"/><br />
you see things like<br />
<img src="/img/4-internet/intfoo.png" title="integer (foo)" alt="integer (foo)" class="ms-4"/>

Snap<em>!</em> has strengths that many programming languages do not,
and it's very likely that your <em>next</em> year's computer science
class will use one of those other languages. If that's the case, you'll
have to make sure that the data type you declare for a variable matches
what you are going to put in it.

A particular online retail company uses 9-bit binary sequences to
identify each unique product for sale. Expecting to increase the number
of products it sells, the company is planning to switch to 10-bit binary
sequences. Which of the statements below best describes the consequence
of using 10-bit sequences instead of 9-bit sequences?

Two more products can be identified uniquely.

Look inside the `translate text to binary sequence` and
`translate binary sequence to text` reporters.
**Describe how these two reporters work.** There are
several custom blocks inside:

<ul>

<li>`pack 8-bit byte` takes a binary sequence of 8 bits or
less and add enough zeros to the front to make a whole byte. How is this
used?</li>

<li>`translate text to Unicode list` takes a text string and
outputs a list of each character's Unicode value. Why is a list output
helpful here?</li>

</ul>
