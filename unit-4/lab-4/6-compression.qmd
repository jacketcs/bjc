<strong>On this page,</strong> you learn about different <em>data
compression algorithms</em>.
:::

::: ap-standard
DAT-1.D.1
:::

<p>The size of data (the number of bits required to store it) affects
the time it takes to send that data across the Internet. So, people use
<em>data compression</em> algorithms to reduce the size of images,
sounds, movies and some other kinds of data.</p>

::: ap-standard
DAT-1.D.3
:::

<p>

The amount of size reduction depends on two things:

<ol>

<li>the amount of redundancy in the original data</li>

<li>the compression algorithm applied</li>

</ol>

</p>

<p>There are two broad categories of data compression algorithms:
<em>lossless</em> and <em>lossy,</em> depending on whether information
is lost.</p>

::: vocabFullWidth
: <strong>Lossless Compression</strong>

<p><strong>Lossless data compression</strong> algorithms (such as PNG)
are reversible (there is no loss in quality); you can reconstruct the
original data.</p>
:::

::: ap-standard
DAT-1.D.4
:::

<p>Lossless compression works by <em>removing redundant data</em>. These
algorithms can <em>usually</em> reduce the number of bits required to
store or transmit the data while guaranteeing that the original data can
be perfectly reconstructed.</p>

<img src="/img/6-computers/bjc-logo-original.png" title="BJC logo uncompressed" alt="BJC logo uncompressed" class="imageRight"/>

<p>Run-length encoding is an example of lossless compression. Consider
the 158 pixels in the top row of the BJC logo (at right). The first 60
pixels are white. Then come five pixels of yellowish orange (the top
slice of the "b"). And the rest of that row is white.</p>

<p class="indent">

...<img src="/img/6-computers/top-row-of-pixels-in-bjc-logo.png" title="top-row-of-pixels-in-bjc-logo: 4 white, 6 yellow-orange, 3 white" alt="top-row-of-pixels-in-bjc-logo: 4 white, 6 yellow-orange, 3 white"/>...

</p>

<p>Instead of storing all 158 pixels individually, we could compress
them with <em>run-length encoding</em> and just store six values (three
numbers and three colors):</p>

+-------------+------------+
| pixel count | color code |
+=============+============+
| 60          | FFFFFF     |
+-------------+------------+
| 5           | E5A84A     |
+-------------+------------+
| 93          | FFFFFF     |
+-------------+------------+

::: ap-standard
DAT-1.D.2
:::

<p>Those six values (60, FFFFFF, 5, E5A84A, 93, FFFFFF) can be
reconstructed into that whole first row of the image (158 pixels). So,
fewer bits does not necessarily mean less information.</p>

::: vocabFullWidth
: <strong>Lossy Compression</strong>

<p><strong>Lossy data compression</strong> algorithms are <em>not</em>
fully reversible; you can reconstruct only an <em>approximation</em> of
the original data.</p>
:::

::: ap-standard
DAT-1.D.5
:::

<p>Lossy Compression works by removing details that people aren't likely
to notice. The most commonly used lossy compression algorithm for
pictures is called JPEG (or JPG, both pronounced "jay peg" for "Joint
Photographic Experts Group," the committee that invented it). JPEG works
by preserving most of the brightness information for each pixel (since
human eyes are sensitive to that) and performing a kind of averaging
process to the color information (because human eyes aren't as good at
distinguishing color, especially colors close to white).</p>

<p>Below are an original, uncompressed picture of pebbles in a pond and
a highly compressed JPEG of the same image. Can you tell which is
which?<br />
<img src="/img/6-computers/pond.bmp" title="pond pebbles" alt="pond pebbles" class="indent"/>
<img src="/img/6-computers/pond.jpg" title="pond pebbles" alt="pond pebbles"/></p>

<p>You probably <em>can</em> tell which is which, especially if you
looked for sharp edges or very shiny spots. But the compressed file uses
1/30th of the space used by the original, and you could still tell that
it's a picture of rocks. So, for many purposes the compressed version
would be good enough. Lossy algorithms usually let you <em>control the
degree of precision</em>, and generally, people select less extreme
compression settings, so the compressed file looks much more like the
original than this example.</p>

<p>The MP3 format, which you almost certainly use for portable music
files, is a lossy compression format. It tends to emphasize high
frequencies, so people accustomed to MP3 music find uncompressed
versions of the same music boomy (bassy).</p>

<h3>Which is best?</h3>

<p>

Both types of data compression exist because each is useful in certain
circumstances:

<ul>

::: ap-standard
DAT-1.D.7
:::

<li>Lossless compression is a good choice when there are very sharp
transitions between colors (such as in logos) <em>or</em> when it's
essential to be able to recreate original data precisely (such as the
code for a program or the text of a book).</li>

::: ap-standard
DAT-1.D.6, DAT-1.D.8
:::

<li>Lossy compression is a good choice when the data does not require
precision (such as images, sound, or movies, which people may not even
notice have been compressed) <em>and</em> when reducing number of bits
stored or transmitted is most important.</li>

</ul>

These questions are similar to those you will see on the AP CSP exam.
<!-- Question 1 -->

::: {.assessment-data type="multiplechoice" identifier="Which is NOT an explanation of low image quality?" hasinlinefeedback="true" maxchoices="1" responseidentifier="ri1" shuffle="false"}
::: prompt
A film student records a movie on his smartphone and then saves a copy
on his computer. He notices that the saved copy is of much lower image
quality than the original. Which of the following could
<strong>NOT</strong> be a possible explanation for the lower image
quality?
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c1"}
::: text
The movie was saved using fewer bits per second (a lower bit rate) than
the original movie.
:::

::: feedback
This is likely what happened. Which one could NOT be a possible
explanation?
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c2"}
::: text
The copy of the movie file was somehow corrupted in the process of
saving.
:::

::: feedback
This is possible; however if the file is corrupted, it is unlikely to
have a consistent negative impact on image quality.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c3"}
::: text
The movie was saved using a lossy compression technique.
:::

::: feedback
This is very likely. Which one could NOT be a possible explanation?
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c4"}
::: text
Whenever a file is saved from one computer to another, some information
is always lost.
:::

::: feedback
Correct. It is possible to make exact duplicates of digital information
without any loss.

<!-- Question 2 -->

::: {.assessment-data type="multiplechoice" identifier="Which are examples of lossless transformation?" hasinlinefeedback="true" maxchoices="2" responseidentifier="ri2" shuffle="true"}
::: prompt
A visual artist is processing a digital image. Which of the following
describe a <strong>lossless</strong> transformation from which the
original image can be recovered? <em>Choose two answers.</em>
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c1"}
::: text
Creating the negative of an image, where colors are reversed (dark areas
appear light).
:::

::: feedback
Correct. This transformation is reversible and is an example of a
lossless transformation.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c2"}
::: text
Blurring the edges of an image.
:::

::: feedback
The blurring blends colors at the edges of the image and once colors
have blended it is impossible to retrieve the original RGB values of the
pixels involved.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c3"}
::: text
Creating a grayscale copy of an image.
:::

::: feedback
The grayscale of an image replaces each RGB value with their average and
once the amounts of red, green, and blue have been averaged together, it
is impossible to retrieve the original RGB values of the pixels.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c4"}
::: text
Creating a vertically flipped copy of the image.
:::

::: feedback
Correct. This transformation is reversible and is an example of a
lossless transformation.
:::
:::

::: {.responseDeclaration identifier="ri2"}
::: {.correctResponse identifier="c1"}

::: ap-standard
DAT-1.D
:::

::: {.assessment-data type="multiplechoice" identifier="Which are examples of lossless transformation?" hasinlinefeedback="true" maxchoices="2" responseidentifier="ri3" shuffle="true"}
::: prompt
For which of the following kinds of data would <em>lossy</em>
compression be okay? Check as many as apply.
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c1"}
::: text
The HTML code for this web page.
:::

::: feedback
Would you be happy if some of the words on the page disappeared?
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c2"}
::: text
Your computer's desktop picture.
:::

::: feedback
Correct. The picture could have a few wrong pixels and would still look
okay.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c3"}
::: text
A live-action movie on Netflix.
:::

::: feedback
Correct. The movie could have a few corrupted frames and would still
look okay.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c4"}
::: text
A cartoon on Netflix.
:::

::: feedback
Actually, corrupted frames are more noticeable in a cartoon, which has
solid areas separated by sharp edges. (Fortunately, using techniques
such as run length encoding, it's relatively easy to get a lossless,
highly compressed version of a cartoon.)
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c5"}
::: text
A digital book, to be read on a computer.
:::

::: feedback
Digital books aren't stored as pictures, but as text. Any error will be
noticeable, as gibberish characters on the page.
