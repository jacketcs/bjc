There's always something more you can do to make a program better. <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll improve your game by making Alonzo welcome the player when the green flag (<img src="/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" title="green-flag button" alt="green-flag button" class="button"/>) is clicked.

::: {#first .forYouToDo}
<ol>

<li>If your project is open and the script is still running, click the red stop sign, <img src="/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" title="red stop button" alt="red stop button"/>. If it isn't open already, open your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project.</li>

</ol>
:::

<p>Clicking the green flag button in the top right corner of the window (<img src="/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" title="green-flag button" alt="green-flag button" class="button"/>) starts all scripts that begin with the <code>when green flag clicked</code> hat block.<br /> <img src="/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" title="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When &apos;picture of a green flag&apos; is clicked" alt="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When &apos;picture of a green flag&apos; is clicked" class="ms-4"/></p>

<ol start="2">

<!--<div class="index-term" id="say</code>"></div>-->

<li>Create a second script that makes Alonzo <img src="/img/blocks/say-empty.png" title="say ()" alt="say ()"/> a welcome message when the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to 'Click Alonzo!' Keep clicking me if you can!")</li>

<li>

Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.

::: endnote
The <code>say</code> block with an empty text in the white <em><strong>input</strong></em> slot will make the sprite say nothing.

</li>

<li>

Check that your app does everything you want:

<ul>

<li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should welcome the player.</li>

<li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage, face the other way, and get more transparent.</li>

<li>Alonzo should start to reappear (but shouldn't face the other way) any time he moves without being clicked.</li>

</ul>

</li>
