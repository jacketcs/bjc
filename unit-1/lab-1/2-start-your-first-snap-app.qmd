<p>This is a computer program, also known as <em>software</em>. It's a very short one, but it'll get more interesting soon.</p>

</li>

<li>Test your program: Click on the Alonzo sprite on the stage several times. If your program works, Alonzo should move to a random position on the stage each time you click him.</li>

::: endnote
If your program doesn't work, look back at the picture of the code and make sure yours matches exactly.

<ul>

<li>Make sure the two blocks are attached to each other by moving the <code>when I am clicked</code> block and checking that the <code>go to</code> block moves with it.</li>

<li>Make sure that the first block says <code>when I am (clicked)</code> and not something else, and make sure that the second block says <code>go to (random position)</code> and not something else.</li>

<p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img src="/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" title="green-flag button" alt="green-flag button" class="button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks." Using events to control a program is called <em><strong>event-driven programming</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Not every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>

<h2>Making the Game Challenging</h2>

<!--<div class="index-term" id="forever</code> loop" />-->

<p>The game isn't much fun if Alonzo just sits there waiting to be clicked. Once you've clicked him, he should keep jumping around on his own. To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this <code>forever</code>." And there is a block that does it:<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/forever.png" title="forever" alt="forever" class="indent"/></p>

A bunch of blocks clicked together is called a <em>script</em>.
:::

Attach this to the bottom of your Alonzo script:<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/forever-jump.png" title="forever {
go to (random position)
}" alt="forever {
go to (random position)
}" class="indent"/>

::: narrower
The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you <strong>click the red stop sign</strong>, <img src="/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" title="red stop button" alt="red stop button"/>, or stop the script in some other way.

<!--<div class="index-term" id="wait</code>"></div>-->

Alonzo moves too fast. Use the <img src="/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" title="wait 1 secs" alt="wait 1 secs"/> block to slow him down. Try your program, and increase or reduce the wait time if you like.

::: endnote
Where the <code>wait</code> block goes in your script matters. Do you want the script to wait one time or each time Alonzo moves?
