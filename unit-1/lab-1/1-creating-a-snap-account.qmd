## Creating an Account

:::: forYouToDo

1. If you haven't already opened [snap]{.snap}, open it now: <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run" title="Snap! Build Your Own Blocks" target="_blank"><strong>http://snap.berkeley.edu/run</strong></a>

<img src="/img/sys/dialog-cloud-signup.png" title="signing up for the cloud" alt="signing up for the cloud" class="float-end"/>

2. In the Snap<em>!</em> window, click the Cloud menu (<img src="/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" title="Cloud menu button" alt="Cloud menu button"/>), , select "Signup...", and follow the instructions.
    - Please **use your first name somewhere in your username**. *Do not* just use your random non-sensical "handle" that you might use in a game, but rather something that we can *easily know who is who based off the username*.

You'll be asked to click a link in your email to verify your account, but you don't have to do that right now.

You may change your password at any time using the Cloud menu, <img src="/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" title="Cloud menu button" alt="Cloud menu button"/>.

## Logging In to and Out of Your Snap<em>!</em> Account

:::: forYouToDo
You should be logged in whenever you are in Snap<em>!</em>. Here's how to check if you are logged in:

3. Click the Cloud menu in the tool-bar.
- <strong>If</strong> it says "Logout" and your user name, then you are already logged in.
- <strong>If</strong> it says someone else's user name, then log them out and log in with your own user name.
- <strong>Otherwise</strong>, choose "Login..." and enter your user name and password.

4. Click to the next page to continue (navigation at the bottom of the page, or the left side bar)

::: endnote
Remember to log out of Snap<em>!</em> (using the Cloud menu) when you are done.
