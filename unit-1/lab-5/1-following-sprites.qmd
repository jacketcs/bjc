    ### **Creating a New Snap<em>!</em> Project**

    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

    <li>

    Open <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/run" title="Snap!" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em></a>.

    ::: endnote
    If you already have Snap<em>!</em> open and there is a project open, follow these steps first:

    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">

    <li>If necessary, save your open work in Snap<em>!</em>.</li>

    <li>Choose "New" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu, <img src="/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" title="File menu button" alt="File menu button"/>.</li>

    <li>Click "Yes" to open a new project (and close the open one).</li>

    </ol>

    :::

    </li>

    <li>Choose "Save As..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu, <img src="/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" title="File menu button" alt="File menu button"/>.</li>

    <li>Type the project name.</li>

    <li>Click the "Save" button.</li>

(@) <img src="/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner" alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline"/> Read and think about this script before you build it. What do you expect it to do?<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/follow-that-mouse.png" title="when green flag clicked{forever{go to x:(mouse x) y:(mouse y)}}" alt="when green flag clicked{forever{go to x:(mouse x) y:(mouse y)}}" class="ms-4 mt-2"/>

(@) Now build the script and run it. Move your mouse around the stage while the program is running. What does the `forever` block do?

    ::: endnote
    To <em>stop</em> your script, click the red stop sign: <img src="/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" title="stop button" alt="stop button" class="button" style="height:1.9em;"/>

## Programming a Second Sprite

::: forYouToDo
(@) Create a second sprite by clicking on the <img src="/img/1-introduction/add-a-new-turtle-sprite.png" title="add a new turtle sprite" alt="add a new turtle sprite"/> button just below the stage.

    ::: endnote

    The new sprite, automatically named **Sprite(2)**, appears on the stage. It's brand new, so it has no scripts. The pictures of the sprites beneath the stage let you select the sprite you want to program.

    :::

(@) To make your sprite names meaningful, change the name of **Sprite** to **Leader**, and change **Sprite(2)** to **Follower**.

::: narrower

### **Changing the Name of a Sprite**

Look for the name in a gray box above the scripting area. Click inside the name and you'll be able to edit it.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/change-sprite-name.jpg" title="image of sprite name input field above the scripting area and below the project name" alt="image of sprite name input field above the scripting area and below the project name" class="ms-4 mt-2"/>

::: sidenoteBig
While a script is running, its border lights up. If the running time is short, you may not notice the brief flash.
:::

(@)  Make sure you have the **Follower** sprite selected. Write a script for **Follower** so that once the green flag is clicked, it will point toward **Leader** `forever`.<br /> <img src="/img/blocks/point-towards.png" title="point towards []" alt="point towards []" class="ms-4 mt-2"/>


::: sidenoteBig
Both sprites have scripts that use <img src="/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" title="When &apos;Green Flag&apos; Clicked" alt="When &apos;Green Flag&apos; Clicked" class="inline"/>, so <em>both</em> of those scripts run when <img src="/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" title="green-flag button" alt="green-flag button" style="height:1.9em;"/> is clicked.
:::

(@)  Click <img src="/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" title="green-flag button" alt="green-flag button" style="height:1.9em;"/> and check that your scripts do what you intended:
    - **Leader** always follows your mouse when you move your mouse around.
    - **Follower** stays in one place, but always points toward **Leader**.
