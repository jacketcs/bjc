In many programs, the visual elements on the screen need to interact---follow each other, avoid each other, react a certain way when they meet each other, etc. 

**In this lab,** you will program <em>two</em> sprites. One sprite will follow your mouse. The other sprite will chase the first. When they meet, they will have a short conversation.
