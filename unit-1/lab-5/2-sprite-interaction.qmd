Brian, the solution file needs to be updated for the new version of TELL (see <a href="https://piazza.com/class/h8yx482idav52y?cid=1733" target="_blank">relevant piazza post</a>), and the problem that includes TELL (the solutions appear to use broadcast instead). --MF, 11/6/17

<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will change the script so that the sprites don't move forever, but only until they touch.</p>
:::

::: {#first .forYouToDo}
<ol>

<li>

Change <strong>Follower</strong>'s code to point towards <strong>Leader</strong> only until it is touching <strong>Leader</strong>. (The following instructions show how.)

<ol>

<li>Select <strong>Follower</strong> by clicking its button below the stage.</li>

<li>Replace the `forever` block with a `repeat until` block.</li>

<li>

Drag <img src="/img/blocks/touching.png" title="touching ()?" alt="touching ()?"/> into the hexagonal space in the `repeat until` block. Set it to repeat until it is `touching` <strong>Leader</strong>.<br />

<li>Do the same for <strong>Leader</strong>. Change its code to follow your mouse only until it is `touching` <strong>Follower</strong>.</li>

<li>

Test your program to see if it does what you want:

<ul>

<li>When you click <img src="/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" title="green-flag button" alt="green-flag button" style="height:1.6em;"/>, <strong>Leader</strong> (the gray one) should follow your mouse and <strong>Follower</strong> should keep turning to face <strong>Leader</strong>.</li>

<li>If you bring <strong>Leader</strong> close enough to touch <strong>Follower</strong>, both sprites should stop moving.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

So far, <strong>Follower</strong> <em>points </em>toward <strong>Leader</strong>, but doesn't <em>move</em> toward it.\

<ol>

<li>

Add a line of code to <strong>Follower</strong>'s script so that it chases <strong>Leader</strong>. Here's the idea:<br />

::: sidenote
Fill the input slot in the `move` block with a small number so <strong>Follower</strong> doesn't catch <strong>Leader</strong> too quickly.
:::

<img src="/img/1-introduction/move-tiny.png" title="when green flag clicked:
repeat until (touching (Leader)?)
{
point towards (Leader)
move () steps ← Comment: Type a small value in this empty input slot.
}" alt="when green flag clicked:
repeat until (touching (Leader)?)
{
point towards (Leader)
move () steps ← Comment: Type a small value in this empty input slot.
}" class="ms-4"/>

</li>



<li>What happens if the sprites are already touching? That is, what happens if you drag one sprite on top of the other and then click the green flag? Why?</li>



<li>Experiment. What happens if the input to `move` is 0?</li>

The language used on the AP Exam doesn't allow spaces in names of inputs (such as <var>number of fish</var>) or in programmer-defined procedures (such as `mouse y`, which isn't built into their language). So this example translates them to

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">numFish</pre>
```
and

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">MouseY()</pre>
```
.
:::

::: pseudop
The reason for the

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">()</pre>
```
or box after

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">MouseY</pre>
```
is that

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">MouseY()</pre>
```
is a procedure call even though it doesn't take any inputs.

<p>Right now, when the sprites meet, they just stop. Make them have a conversation when they stop. You can do that by adding code like this to <strong>Leader</strong>'s script. Make up your own conversation. You can use any language you can type. Here's an example using several languages.</p>

<strong>Leader</strong> does things itself. It also tells <strong>Follower</strong> what to do and when to do it. This code puts <strong>Leader</strong> in charge of <strong>Follower</strong>.

To prevent the two sprites from being stuck to each other unable to move, the sprites will need some space between them and some time apart before the chase starts. Blocks such as these may help.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/U1ImageVideoAddendum_img/U1L5p2-PuppySeparation.png" title="go to x:(-200) y:(-50); wait (1) secs &amp; go to x:(200) y:(-50); wait (1) secs" alt="go to x:(-200) y:(-50); wait (1) secs &amp; go to x:(200) y:(-50); wait (1) secs" class="ms-4" height="90"/>
