<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will program two sprites to gossip.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/U1L2-Gossip.jpg" title="Image of stage with two characters talking.

There is nothing exactly like <img src="/img/1-introduction/say-gossip.png" title="say (gossip)" alt="say (gossip)" class="nopadtb"/> or <img src="/img/1-introduction/say-gossip-for-3-secs.png" title="say (gossip) for (3) secs" alt="say (gossip) for (3) secs" class="nopadtb"/> on the AP Exam because they don't have sprites and speech balloons, but their way of showing this text to the user is

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">DISPLAY(gossip())</pre>
```
if it's written as text or <img src="/img/1-introduction/display(gossip).png" title="a white rounded rectangle containing first the word &apos;DISPLAY&apos; in all caps and then a smaller white rectangle containing the word &apos;gossip&apos; in lower case" alt="a white rounded rectangle containing first the word &apos;DISPLAY&apos; in all caps and then a smaller white rectangle containing the word &apos;gossip&apos; in lower case" class="nopadtb"/> if it's shown as blocks.

<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is the most fundamental idea in computer science, but it's hard to define until you've seen some examples. The most basic kind of abstraction is to <em>give a name</em> to something in a program. For example, here we gave the name <code>who</code> to the idea "pick an item at random from this list of people (or cats)." This is called <strong><em>procedural</em> abstraction</strong> because we use a procedure (a block) to name the idea. This makes your code readable. You'll see other kinds of abstraction later.</p>

<p>If you find yourself wanting to copy and paste code from one place to another without changing it, then give it a name (open a Block Editor and paste the code there) and call your procedure in both places. If you discover later on that you need to fix a bug in this code, you only have to change it once instead of finding every copy throughout your program.</p>
