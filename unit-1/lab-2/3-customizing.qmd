**On this page,** you will edit the word lists used by the sprites and debug any problems.

(@) Open your U1L2-Gossip project. Edit these three reporter blocks to change the phrases that the program uses. (See the instructions in the box below.) Be creative and funny but thoughtful.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/who.png" title="who block" alt="who block" class="ms-4"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/does-what.png" title="does what block" alt="does what block" class="inline"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/who2.png" title="who2 block" alt="who2 block" class="inline"/>

### **How to Edit a Block**

a. **Find the block** in the scripting area or the colored palettes on the left.
b. **Control-click** (or right-click) on the block and choose "edit..."
c. **Make changes** to the block's internal code. (Instructions are already inside these blocks.)
d. **Click OK** when you're satisfied. (Or click "Cancel" if you don't want to make changes.)

::: {#hint-report .collapse}
The `report` and `say` blocks mean very different things. `Report` tells something to the computer, and that value can be used as input to another block, such as the `join` block inside `gossip`. `Say` just shows a value to the user in a speech bubble.

::: {#ordered .collapse}
It doesn't mean that the items have to appear in alphabetical or numeric order. It just means that <img src="/img/1-introduction/list-a-b.png" title="(list a b" alt="(list a b)" height="57"/> is a different list from <img src="/img/1-introduction/list-b-a.png" title="(list b a)" alt="(list b a)" height="57"/>.
:::
:::

- A **list** is an ordered sequence of items. You've seen this example:<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/list-from-who-result.png" title="list{Senora, Ms. C, my cat, Hannah, Jake}" alt="list{Senora, Ms. C, my cat, Hannah, Jake}" class="ms-4"/>
- The items of this list are <em>strings</em>. A **string** is a sequence of characters (letters, digits, punctuation, etc.). A **substring** is just a piece of some existing string. For example, "Hanna," "anna", and "nnah" are each substrings of the string "Hannah." (The empty string as well as the original string are both also substrings.)
- To **concatenate** strings means to make a bigger string by connecting two or more smaller strings. In Snap<em>!</em>, the <img src="/img/blocks/join()().png" title="join () ()" alt="join () ()" class="inline py-0"/> block lets you concatenate strings.

The process of testing, finding problems, and fixing them is called **debugging**.
:::

(@) Make sure your program works. Test each block as well as the program as a whole. If something doesn't work, don't go on without fixing it.

    It's true that there are two people (two "who"s) and one action (one "does what"), but they aren't in the right order. Also, the word "and" isn't anywhere in the program.
