<p><strong>On this page, </strong> you will improve your program so that sometimes the sentences are a bit longer and more complex.</p>
:::

The block <img src="/img/1-introduction/more-complicated-who.png" title="more complicated who" alt="more complicated who"/> has been built for you. It randomly chooses 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if that number is 3, then it reports something more complicated than <code>who</code>. Otherwise, it reports <code>who</code>, just as before.

: <strong>Expressions</strong> and <strong>Values</strong>

<ul>

<li>An <strong>expression</strong> is a either a constant value (such as "4" or "winter") or a call to a reporter block including its inputs (such as <img src="/img/2-complexity/number.png" title="number" alt="number" class="inline"/>, <img src="/img/1-introduction/5+(4x3).png" title="5 + (4 * 3)" alt="5 + (4 * 3)" class="inline py-0"/>, or <img src="/img/2-complexity/join-who-doeswhat-who.png" title="join (who) ( ) (does what) ( ) (who)" alt="join (who) ( ) (does what) ( ) (who)" class="inline"/>).</li>

<li>Expressions are evaluated to produce a <em>single</em> <strong>value</strong> (a value can be a number, a string, a sprite, a costume, a script, a list---anything). For example, <img src="/img/1-introduction/5+(4x3).png" title="5 + (4 * 3)" alt="5 + (4 * 3)" class="inline py-0"/> will be evaluated to 17.</li>

You have the right idea, using

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">RANDOM(1, 6)</pre>
```
for the roll of a single die. But this expression doesn't roll two dice; it rolls one die and doubles the result. So

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">2 * RANDOM(1, 6)</pre>
```
will only return 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.
