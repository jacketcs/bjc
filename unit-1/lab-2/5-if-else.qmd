**On this page, ** you will improve your program so that sometimes the sentences are a bit longer and more complex.

The block <img src="/img/1-introduction/more-complicated-who.png" title="more complicated who" alt="more complicated who"/> **has been built for you** (look through the blocks to find it) (hint: what colour is this block? where are all blocks of that colour contained?). It randomly chooses 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if that number is 3, then it reports something more complicated than `who`. Otherwise, it reports `who`, just as before.

: **Expressions** and **Values**

- An **expression** is a either a constant value (such as "4" or "winter") or a call to a reporter block including its inputs (such as <img src="/img/2-complexity/number.png" title="number" alt="number" class="inline"/>, <img src="/img/1-introduction/5+(4x3).png" title="5 + (4 * 3)" alt="5 + (4 * 3)" class="inline py-0"/>, or <img src="/img/2-complexity/join-who-doeswhat-who.png" title="join (who) ( ) (does what) ( ) (who)" alt="join (who) ( ) (does what) ( ) (who)" class="inline"/>).</li>

- Expressions are evaluated to produce a <em>single</em> **value** (a value can be a number, a string, a sprite, a costume, a script, a list---anything). For example, <img src="/img/1-introduction/5+(4x3).png" title="5 + (4 * 3)" alt="5 + (4 * 3)" class="inline py-0"/> will be evaluated to 17.</li>

The expression <img src="/img/blocks/pick-random-1-to-10-full-size.png" title="pick random (1) to (10)" alt="pick random (1) to (10)" class="inline"/> would be written as
```
RANDOM(1, 10)
```
or <img src="/img/1-introduction/random-blocktran.png" title="RANDOM(1, 10)" alt="RANDOM(1, 10)" class="inline"/>. Every time you run this code, you will get a different random number between 1 and 10.

    An **even** number is an integer that is divisible by 2 (such as 2, 14, 0, -4, -6, -28, and -176).

    You have the right idea, using

    ```{=html}
    <pre class="inline">RANDOM(1, 6)</pre>
    ```
    for the roll of a single die. But this expression doesn't roll two dice; it rolls one die and doubles the result. So

    ```{=html}
    <pre class="inline">2 * RANDOM(1, 6)</pre>
    ```
    will only return 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.
