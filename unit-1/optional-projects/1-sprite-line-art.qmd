<li>

Here are some things to do at the start of your program `when green flag clicked`:

<ul>

<li>Clear any previous drawings</li>

<li>Place the drawing sprite at the center of the screen</li>

<li>Point it in the up direction</li>

<li>Set the drawing pen to a color and size of your choice</li>

<li>Put pen down to get ready for drawing</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Write code that will clear the drawings `when space key pressed` by the user.</li>

<li>The user will use the arrow keys to draw. You'll need a script for each key, starting with a `when key pressed` block:<br /> <img src="/img/blocks/when-space-key-pressed.png" alt="when space key pressed" class="ms-4"/><br /> For each of the four arrow keys, make the sprite point in the direction of the arrow and then move forward 10 steps.</li>

</ol>

Here is how Snap<em>!</em> assigns angles for directions: <br />

<ul>

<li>0° is up</li>

<li>90° is right</li>

<li>180° is down</li>

<li>-90° (or also 270°) is left</li>

</ul>

::: ifTime
<ol start="4">

<li>Change your code to draw only if the sprite is within the screen dimensions: -240 to 240 in the x direction (horizontal) and -180 to 180 in the y direction (vertical).</li>

<li>Give your user some coloring options. For example, when the "1" key is pressed, the pen color is reset to black; when the "2" key is pressed, the pen color is set to red; etc. (Suggestion: Load the crayon library) Also consider using some keys to put the `pen up` or `pen down`.</li>

<li>Give your user the option to draw diagonal lines. For example, write code to move the sprite at 45°, 135°, 225°, 315°, using the "w," "s," "a," and "q" keys.</li>
