<li><strong>nouns</strong> (things)</li>

<li><strong>verbs</strong> (actions)</li>

<li><strong>adjectives</strong> (thing describers)</li>

<li><strong>adverbs</strong> (action describers)</li>

<li><strong>determiners</strong> (identifiers---tells you <em>which</em> thing)</li>

<p>It contains six reporters that each report a random word from a list of words in that category.</p>

</li>

<li>Try out each block to see what it does. Then change these lists however you like to include your own nouns, verbs, etc.</li>

<li>Create a reporter called <code>simple sentence</code> that reports a simple sentence using the <code>random determiner</code>, <code>random noun</code>, and <code>random verb</code> blocks. <img src="/img/1-introduction/simple-sentence-reporting.png" title="simple sentence reporting &apos;a boy jumps&apos;" alt="simple sentence reporting &apos;a boy jumps&apos;" class="ms-4"/></li>

<li>

More complicated sentences can be built up from multiple phrases. Create these phrase reporters:

<ol>

<li><img src="/img/3-lists/noun_phrase.png" title="green noun phrase reporter block" alt="green noun phrase reporter block" border="0"/> should join words from two categories to make phrases like "the sandwich" or "a giraffe," or from three categories to create phrases like "the little boy," "a green giraffe," or "our old sandwich."</li>

<li><img src="/img/3-lists/prep_phrase.png" title="green prepositional phrase reporter block" alt="green prepositional phrase reporter block" border="0"/> should combine a preposition with a <code>noun phrase</code> to create phrases like "near the little boy" or "over a wise pizza."</li>

::: takeNote
Using <code>noun phrase</code> to define <code>prepositional phrase</code> is a good example of abstraction. If you later change <code>noun phrase</code> to include people's names, <code>prepositional phrase</code> will still work.
:::

<li><img src="/img/3-lists/verb_phrase.png" title="green verb phrase reporter block" alt="green verb phrase reporter block" border="0"/> should report either just a verb like "jumps" or join a verb and an adverb to create combinations like "jumps sadly," "naps quickly," or "thinks sleepily."</li>

</ol>

</li>

::: endnote
These phrases will be grammatically correct, but they won't necessarily make sense. For example, <code>noun phrase</code> might generate "a tired pizza."
:::

<li>Then, make a reporter <code>complicated sentence</code> that combines a noun phrase, a verb phrase, and a prepositional phrase. <img src="/img/1-introduction/complicated-sentence-reporting.png" title="complicated sentence reporting &apos;my silly elephant in front of your tired elephant sits down quickly&apos;" alt="complicated sentence reporting &apos;my silly elephant in front of your tired elephant sits down quickly&apos;" class="ms-4"/></li>

::: takeItFurther
<ol type="A">

<li>Occasionally, include people's names instead of a <code>noun phrase</code>. So, instead of something like "my silly elephant," the program could sometimes use "Jamie" or other names.</li>

<li>Noun phrases don't always have to have one adjective. They can have none, or two, or more. Add some variety.</li>
