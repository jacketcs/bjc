<strong>In this project,</strong> you are going to write code to draw the geometric design shown below, explore its variations and use it draw more complex designs.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/Daisy.png" title="Daisy" alt="Daisy" class="indent noshadow" width="242"/>

<li>The entire design is made up of circles. So the first thing to do is to write code that will create a circle. To do this, create a custom block <code>Draw Circle</code> via the "Variables" menu "Make a block" option. Hint: A regular polygon with 30 or more sides is a good approximation for a circle.</li>

<li>Now that you can draw a circle, you can generate the Daisy Design by rotating your sprite a bit at the end of each circle drawn. In the design above there are 24 circles. How much must the sprite turn each time a circle is drawn in order to make a full cycle of 360° when all the circles are drawn? Create a custom block <code>Draw Daisy</code> to do this.</li>

<!-- <div class="endnote">If you get stuck in any of the previous steps, you can look at <a href="/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-projects/3b-daisy-hints.html" target="_blank">this page </a>for hints.</div>-->

<ol type="A">

<li>Extend your code so that you can create the following patterns.<br/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/DoubleDaisy.png" title="Two Daisies" alt="Two Daisies" class="indent" width="240"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/TrioDaisy.png" title="Triangle of Daisies" alt="Triangle of  Daisies" class="indent" width="240"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/TripleDaisy.png" title="Three Daisies" alt="Three Daisies" class="indent" width="240"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/SixDaisy.png" title="Hexagon of Daisies" alt="Hexagon of Daisies" class="indent" width="240"/></li>

<li>Consider the following variations on the pen color and thickness for the Daisy Design. Note that in the first design, color changes within each circle, while in the second design, pen thickness changes within each circle. Study the code and explore your own such variations.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/penColor.png" title="set pen hue to ((abs of(direction))/3.6)" alt="set pen hue to ((abs of(direction))/3.6)" class="indent" width="400"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/ColoredDaisy.png" title="Color variation in Daisy" alt="Color variation in Daisy" class="indent" height="250"/><br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/penSize.png" title="set pen size to(abs of((direction-180)/30)" alt="set pen size to(abs of((direction-180)/30)" class="indent" width="400"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/VariedThicknessDaisy.png" title="Pen thickness variation in Daisy" alt="Pen thickness variation in Daisy" class="indent" height="250"/></li>

<li>Create your own variations of the Daisy Design and share with your classmates.</li>
