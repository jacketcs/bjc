<p><strong>In this project,</strong> you'll use abstractions inside of abstractions to build a row of houses.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/row-of-houses-size-100.png" title="a drawing of a row of houses" alt="a drawing of a row of houses" class="ms-4 noshadow" style="height: 119px;"/></p>

Using <code>draw</code> square as an example of where to start, create and test a <code>draw triangle</code> block that takes a <var>size</var> as input and draws an equilateral triangle.<br />

<li>

Now, use <code>draw square</code> and <code>draw triangle</code> together to create a <code>draw house</code> blocks that takes a <var>size</var> as input and draws a house shape: a square with a triangular shaped roof sitting on top.<br />

::: sidenote
You might have to do some debugging to get the two shapes to connect properly.

Using a block inside another block is a form of <em>abstraction</em>.

<li>Finally, use your <code>draw house</code> block together with <code>repeat until</code> to create a <code>draw row of houses</code> block that draws a row of attached houses with each new one to the right of the previous. Your program should keep drawing houses until the sprite moves too close to the right edge of the screen. For that, you will need <code>repeat until</code>.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/draw-row-of-houses-size.png" title="draw row of houses, size: ()" alt="draw row of houses, size: ()" class="ms-4"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/row-of-houses-size-100.png" title="a drawing of a row of houses" alt="a drawing of a row of houses" class="ms-4 noshadow"/><br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/repeat-until-(x-position+size-greater-than-240).png" title="repeat until (((x position) + (size)) &gt; 240)" alt="repeat until (((x position) + (size)) &gt; 240)" class="ms-4"/></li>

Now, draw a field of flowers and give each flower a different size, number of petals, and position.<br />
