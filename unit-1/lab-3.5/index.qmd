**In this project,** you'll use abstractions inside of abstractions to build a row of houses.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/row-of-houses-size-100.png" title="a drawing of a row of houses" alt="a drawing of a row of houses" class="ms-4 noshadow" style="height: 119px;"/>

    You might have to do some debugging to get the two shapes to connect properly.

(@) Use your `draw house` block together with `repeat` to create a `draw row of houses` block that draws a row of <var>number</var> attached houses (each of the same <var>size</var>) with each new one to the right of the previous.

We learned about the `pick random` block on [Unit 1, Lab 2, Page 5: Adding Variety to `Gossip`](/unit-1/lab-2/5-if-else.qmd).

It is a reporter block that reports a random number within the range of numbers that you specify.

(@) Houses aren't really stuck next to each other like in the examples that we gave! Edit the `draw row of houses` and `draw group of houses` block so that there are gaps between the houses.

(@) Customize the look of your houses by editing the code of your `draw house` block. Things that you can add to the houses include:
    - Windows, doors, garages, greenery, etc.
    - Consider breaking it down first. e.g., create a block `draw window` that only draws a window then add the block into the `draw house` block.

(@) Create a better way of generating groups of houses. Edit `draw group of houses` so that it uses `pick random` to create a group of houses that can have houses missing (i.e. make it look more "natural")
