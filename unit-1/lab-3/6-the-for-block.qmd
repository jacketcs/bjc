<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will use <code>for</code> loops not only to repeat, but also to count the repetitions and then use that counter to draw shapes with repeated patterns:<br /> <img src="/img/prog/spiral.png" title="spiral" alt="spiral" class="indent"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/nested-squares.png" title="nested squares" alt="nested squares" class="indent"/></p>

You've seen these ways to repeat a set of commands:

<ul>

::: sidenoteBig
The <code>forever</code> block generates an <em>infinite loop</em> that goes on forever. An infinite loop can sometimes be the result of a bug, but in some interactive programs, you <em>want</em> the program to keep running until stopped by the user.
:::

<li><img src="/img/blocks/forever.png" title="the forever block" alt="the forever block" class="inline"/> repeats the same commands <em>forever</em>. (You used it to make Alonzo keep moving in <a href="/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/4-keeping-score.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 1 Lab 1 Page 3: Make It a Game">Unit 1 Lab 1 Page 3: Make It a Game</a>.)</li>

<p>Computer scientists describe a repeating program structure as <em>looping</em>, <em>repetition</em>, or <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>

::: comment
AAP-2.K.1
:::

<p>The code can be repeated <code>forever</code>, a specific number of times (such as when using <code>repeat</code>), or until something specific happens (such as when using <code>repeat until</code> as you'll see in Lab 5). <br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/repeat-4(move-100-turn-right-90).png" title="repeat (4) (move (100), turn clockwise (90))" alt="repeat (4) (move (100), turn clockwise (90))" class="indent"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/move-tiny-no-hat.png" title="repeat until (touching (Leader)?)

<p>Sometimes the script inside a loop needs to know which time through the loop it's in (first, second, etc.). You can use <img src="/img/prog/for.png" title="for(i)=(1) to (10){}" alt="for(i)=(1) to (10){}" class="imageCenter"/> to keep track, and you can use its counter (the default name is <img src="/img/blocks/variable-i.png" title="i" alt="i" class="inline"/>) in the repeated script. For example, the <code>for</code> block lets you simplify long scripts like: <br /> <img src="/img/looping/for-loop-equivalent.png" title="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" alt="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" class="indent"/>\
      to\
<img src="/img/looping/for-loop-drag-i.gif" title="for (i)= (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" alt="for (i)= (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" class="noshadow"/></p>

<p>Each time the <code>for</code> block runs the script inside, it changes the value of the counter by 1, beginning with the first input number and ending after the second.</p>

::: takeNote
The <code>for</code> block's default counter name, <img src="/img/blocks/variable-i.png" title="i" alt="i" class="inline"/> stands for "index." You can change this name by clicking it. To use the counter, drag it into the script.

Okay, now dig in.

::: narrowpurple
<strong>Randomness:</strong> The four examples above are different from the actual Albers picture in that they include occasional colors that aren't from the same family. This can make the pictures more interesting to someone who doesn't share Albers's interest in subtle differences in color. (Albers himself, in fact, had more color variation in other pictures of this type.) <em>Too much</em> randomness, though, can make the picture <em>less</em> interesting. Compare the last two examples above; the left one of those two is clearly based on the orange family, with rainbow-neighbors red and yellow, but the right one has violets, greens, oranges, a yellow---too much chaos, maybe. Look back at the Gossip project if you don't remember how to choose something special once out of six times, or once out of 14 times. Other random choices you can make are the number of squares, how much to shrink the size from one square to the next, and how much to move the corner of the next square horizontally and vertically (the picture is more interesting if those two numbers are different, so the smallest square isn't exactly in the center).
