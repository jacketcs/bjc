<strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn how keeping a programming journal can help your programming.

<img src="/img/icons/write-in-journal.png" title="Write In Your Journal" alt="Write In Your Journal" class="imageRight"/> Every day in your journal, keep notes like the following:

<ul>

<li>Any concept about programming that you had trouble understanding.</li>

<li>Questions that you want to remember to ask.</li>

<li>Ideas for projects that you want to work on or improvements to an existing project that you want to make.</li>

<li>

Problems with your code:

<ul>

<li>What was the symptom?</li>

<li>What did the cause turn out to be?</li>

<li>What change did you make to fix the problem?</li>

<li>What techniques did you use to investigate the problem?</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

How did you organize your code?

<ul>

<li>

Did you define new procedures?

<ul>

<li>Do they take inputs? If so, what type of inputs do they require? (That is, what is their <em>domain</em>?)</li>

<li>Do they take report a value? If so, what type of value do they report? (That is, what is their <em>range</em>?)</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Could you have defined a procedure somewhere instead of copying and pasting code?</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>When appropriate, you might want to include pictures of the stage or of important scripts in your code.</li>

</ul>

You don't need to copy things out of the curriculum into your journal; you can always look those up in the <a href="/summaries/vocab-index.html?course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="curriculum index">index</a>.
:::

<strong>The journal is for you, not for your teacher.</strong> You won't be graded on what you do or don't put in it. The journal isn't graded because it's a record of the things only you experience in the class, not a record of the ideas in the curriculum. Everyone's journal will be different.
