<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about sprite turning angles, which are needed for drawing polygons. For starters, you'll draw various asterisks, like these: <br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Three-spokes.png" title="three spokes" alt="asterisk with three spokes" class="indent"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Five-spokes.png" title="asterisk with five spokes" alt="asterisk with five spokes"/> <img src="/img/1-introduction/Eight-spokes.png" title="asterisk with eight spokes" alt="asterisk with eight spokes"/></p>
:::

<p>When you were trying to draw an equilateral triangle on the previous page, you might have tried code like this:<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/half-hex-code.png" title="repeat (3) {move (100) steps; turn right (60) degrees}" alt="repeat (3) {move (100) steps; turn right (60) degrees}" class="indent"/> and seen a result like this: <img src="/img/1-introduction/half-hex-pic.png" title="three sides of a regular hexagon" alt="three sides of a regular hexagon"/><br /> It's common to try this if you've learned that the angles in an equilateral triangle are all 60 degrees. However, the angle that the <em>sprite</em> needs to turn to make a triangle is actually 120 degrees, and it's important to understand why that is and how to find the correct angle for other polygons (five-sided, eleven-sided, etc.).</p>

<li>Perform the four experiments (A-D), and read the comments attached to each one. As you do, talk with your partner about what you see and why it happens.</li>

<li>

Then, experiment with the last script (shown right):<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/angles-and-turning.png" title="repeat (2): {move (100) steps, move (-100) steps, turn (180) degrees}" alt="repeat (2): {move (100) steps, move (-100) steps, turn (180) degrees}" class="imageRight"/>

<ol>

<li>Experiment with a <em>quarter</em> turn (<code>turn</code> 90 degrees instead of 180). Adjust the number of repetitions (the number you give to <code>repeat</code>) until you get the sprite to finish facing the same way it started.<br /> <img title="animation of drawing an asterisk with four spokes" alt="animation of drawing an asterisk with four spokes" class="indent" data-gifffer="/img/1-introduction/U1ImageVideoAddendum_img/U1L3P2-AngleExperiment-4.gif" height="150"/></li>

<li>Experiment with a <em>tenth</em> of a turn (<code>turn</code> 36 degrees). What input must you give to <code>repeat</code> to get the sprite to finish facing the same way it started?</li>

<li><em>Without trying it on the computer,</em> figure out what turning angle to use for a five-spoke asterisk. Make sure your partner agrees.</li>

<li>Then, try the experiment.</li>

At the top of the page you were thinking about triangles. As a step in that direction, make a three-spoke asterisk.

A 360° turn is a full turn. Half of that (180°) is a half turn. A fourth of 360° <img src="/img/1-introduction/360-divided-by-4-with-result-90.png" title="360-divided-by-4-with-result-90" alt="360-divided-by-4-with-result-90"/> is a quarter turn. You don't have to do the division yourself. Snap<em>!</em> can compute it for you. You can use <img src="/img/1-introduction/turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees.png" title="turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees" alt="turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees"/> or <img src="/img/1-introduction/turn-360-divided-by-3-degrees.png" title="turn-360-divided-by-3-degrees" alt="turn-360-divided-by-3-degrees"/> to get a seventh of a turn or a third of a turn.

<p>At the beginning of this page, you knew that to make a triangle you need 120° turns, but maybe you weren't sure why. Now you know why a <em>three-spoke asterisk</em> takes 120° turns, but what does that have to do with triangles?</p>

Gamal: It looks like a map. Houses on the left, the town center on the right, with City Hall and the fire station and the mall.

</div>

<div>

Betsy: Maybe. To me the part on the left looks a little like a fingerprint, and the part on the right is clearly a person facing right, with her nose up against the right edge, halfway down.

</div>

<div>

Alphie: Never mind what it looks like. How are <em>we</em> going to make something that looks <em>like it?</em>

</div>

<div>

Betsy: Parts of it look like curved, thick dotted lines. We could do something like this:<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/betty-code.png" title="set color to (brown square); set pen size
to (10); set (flat line ends) to (True);
repeat (10) {pen down; move (15) steps; pen
up; move (5) steps; turn right (5) degrees}" alt="set color to (brown square); set pen size
to (10); set (flat line ends) to (True);
repeat (10) {pen down; move (15) steps; pen
up; move (5) steps; turn right (5) degrees}" class="indent"/>      <img src="/img/1-introduction/betty-line.png" title="sprite draws curved thick dotted line" alt="sprite draws curved thick dotted line"/><br /> But I'm not sure how to get a bunch of those to fit together.

</div>

<div>

Alphie: Randomness is your friend. Let's make a bunch of your lines, all different, and just point them in different directions.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/alphie-dotted.png" title="dotted line definition: set pen color to
(brown square); set pen size to (10); set
(flat line ends) to (True); repeat (pick
random (8) to (20)): {pen down; move (pick

</div>

<div>

Betsy: Wow! That's very cool.

</div>

<div>

Alphie: Nothing like what it's supposed to look like, though.

</div>

<div>

Betsy: What do you mean, "supposed"? Go read the boldface line up above this blue box again.

</div>

<div>

Alphie: Yeah, I know, but "take liberties" doesn't mean "take whatever happens on your first try." I have another idea. We've been thinking of Thomas's picture as brown boxes on a white background, but it's actually more brown than white. What if we start with a brown background and draw white lines on it?

</div>

<div>

Gamal: What about that town center on the right?

</div>

<div>

Betsy: It's not a map. But to make you happy, when drawing white lines over toward the right, we can make them thicker, so the right part will have more white space than the left part.

</div>

<div>

Alphie: Uh oh... If you look carefully at the original picture, the brown boxes aren't all the same shade of brown.

</div>

<div>

Betsy: Alphie, you worry too much. But to make <em>you</em> happy, once we have the space divided into brown regions, we can <img src="/img/1-introduction/fill.png" title="fill" alt="fill"/> some of them in different colors.

</div>

<div>

Gamal: Hey! Gang! Remember we imported that crayon library? Guess what! There's a "World Map" library, too! And it makes "watercolor" maps like this:<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/water.png" title="vague map of a town" alt="vague map of a town" class="indent"/><br /> And then I went over every dot on the stage using <img src="/img/1-introduction/my-brightness.png" title="(brightness) at (myself)" alt="(brightness) at (myself)"/> and <img src="/img/1-introduction/my-hue.png" title="(hue) at (myself)" alt="(hue) at (myself)"/> to decide whether to make each dot white or brown:<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/painted.png" title="same vague map of a town but now in brown and white" alt="same vague map of a town but now in brown and white" class="indent"/>
