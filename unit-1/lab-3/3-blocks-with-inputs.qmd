<p>On the previous page you used blocks <code>asterisk</code> and <code>pinwheel</code> that we wrote for you, each with an input for the number of spokes. Now you're going to learn how to create your own blocks with inputs.</p>

<p>The scripts are essentially all the same; only some of the <em>input values</em> change. Instead of having many separate scripts, you can make one general block <img src="/img/1-introduction/pinwheel-block.png" title="pinwheel, branches:()" alt="pinwheel, branches:()" height="40"/> that will draw <em>all</em> such designs. The block has to work for a variety of inputs.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of data can be an input?</strong> All kinds of data. In this example, the input is supposed to be a number, but <em>any</em> kind of value can be used as an input. For instance, you've seen the <code>list</code> block called with text as inputs. In Snap<em>!</em>, any kind of data can be used as an input, can be reported by a block, or can be put in a list.</p>

: What's an input? <strong>Parameter</strong> vs. <strong>Argument</strong>

::: comment
AAP-3.A.3
:::

<p>

<ul>

<li>A <strong>parameter</strong> (or <em>formal parameter</em>) is the input <em>name,</em> such as <var>number of branches</var>. The input name is set in the block definition. It never changes.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/example-parameter.png" title="image of complete pinwheel, branches:(number of branches) block definition with parameter label pointing to number of branches" alt="image of complete pinwheel, branches:(number of branches) block definition with parameter label pointing to number of branches" class="indent"/></li>

<li>An <strong>argument</strong> (or <em>actual argument</em>) is the input <em>value,</em> such as 6 for a hexagonal pinwheel. The input value is given each time the block is run; it can be a different value each time.<br /> <img src="/img/1-introduction/example-argument.png" title="pinwheel, branches: (6) with argument label pointing to the input 6" alt="pinwheel, branches: (6) with argument label pointing to the input 6" class="indent"/></li>

</ul>

We use the word "input" both for parameters (input names) and for arguments (input values).

<p>Originally, you made five copies of the pinwheel script to create five slightly different pinwheels. Now, you've made a single procedure that includes the shared features of these five scripts and uses a parameter to handle the differences.</p>

<h3><strong>Debugging Tip: Commenting Your Code</strong></h3>

::: comment
CRD-2.G.2
:::

<p>

Adding comments to your code may help you remember what your code does, helps other people reading your code to understand it, and can help you avoid bugs by increasing the clarity of your program. But it won't do any of those things if you comment every line of code, so each comment just says how a block inside your script works. You can add comments to your Snap<em>!</em> code by right-clicking (or control-clicking) in the Scripts area and choosing "add comment." <a href="#hint-comments" data-bs-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an animation that shows how to add comments.">Click for an animation that shows how.</a>

:::

</p>

<p>You can attach a comment <em>to the hat block</em> in the Block Editor to create a help message for your block. This is the <em>best</em> way to comment, because people can find out what your block does without having to look inside, just like the help messages for primitive blocks.</p>

<p>Part of the reason some people emphasize the importance of detailed comments is that they are programming in text languages, which discourage long variable and procedure names. (Typically, you can't include spaces in the names, and you have to type the entire name every time you use that variable or procedure.) So you see names like <code>substLcUc</code> instead of <code>substitute lower case letters for capital letters in string</code>. If a program is full of drastically abbreviated names for procedures and variables, it's no surprise if the code needs documentation. In Snap<em>!,</em> the names in the program can be self-documenting.</p>

<h2>More About Program Documentation</h2>

::: comment
CRD-2.G.1, CRD-2.G.5
:::

<p>Commenting is only one form of documentation. It's not the <em>best</em> form, because attaching a comment to a particular place in the program documents only that one procedure or code segment, and doesn't explain how different sections of the program interact. But commenting is an easy way to document small details.</p>

<p>Documentation can be <em>external</em> (written for users of the program) or <em>internal</em> (written for yourself or other developers of the program). Both kinds are important, if it's a program people other than the author are going to use. Usually they should be separate documents---another reason why comments aren't the best form of documentation.</p>

::: comment
CRD-2.G.4
:::

<p>If you're writing a program by yourself, internal documentation may seem silly. "I know how my own program works." But if the program will still be in use a year later, it will probably need maintenance, and you may well have forgotten the details of its implementation. In a programming class like this one, most of the programs you write are very small, and you can understand them at a glance. But real programs are generally much bigger than lab exercises designed to take less than an hour of work.</p>

::: comment
CRD-2.G.3
:::

<p>It's best if the first attempt at documentation is made even before starting to code. The documentation will specify the desired program behavior (external) and the intended program structure (internal). These documents can be used in testing the code to ensure that it behaves as planned.</p>
