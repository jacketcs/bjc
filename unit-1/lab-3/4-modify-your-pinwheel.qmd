<h2>Adding Multiple Inputs</h2>

<p>Recall how you first <em>generalized</em> your original pinwheel script: you added an input called <var>number of branches</var> that controlled the turning angle of the sprite. By adding <em>more</em> inputs, you can generalize other aspects of your program.</p>

The procedures

```
and

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">turn_clockwise()</pre>

aren't built in to the AP's language so they are written in lower case like other programmer-defined procedures.

. The word

<h3><strong>Debugging Tip: Organizing Your Code</strong></h3>

<p>

One way to avoid having bugs in your program in the first place is to keep your code organized by deleting any unused scripts. You can use the <strong>clean up</strong> option by right-clicking (or control-clicking on a Mac) in the scripting area to organize your blocks. You can <strong>remove a block or script</strong> either by dragging it out of the scripting area and back to the palettes on the left or by choosing the "delete" option from the drop-down menu. <a href="#hint-organizing" data-bs-toggle="collapse" title="Click here for a video of cleaning up the scripting area and removing blocks.">Click here for a video</a>. (Note that this is different from the "delete block definition" option which will permanently delete a custom block and all its instances from your entire project.)<br />

<p>You may hear people use the term "pseudocode" to refer to this pseudo-language used on the AP CS Principles exam, but it's <em>not</em> pseudocode. Pseudocode isn't a programming language at all, it's the use of normal human language to describe an algorithm.</p>

On the right is a painting by Vassily Kandinsky. The four pictures above were inspired by it, but the sizes and placement of the circles in the original were carefully chosen, whereas the ones above are random. Also, Kandinsky's solid circles aren't quite uniform in color. For example, the green circle near the top right of the picture has a light green outer border, a somewhat darker green inside, a blue-green inner border, and black inside that.

::: narrowpurple
When two solid circles overlap, you can see both colors, or rather, a color in between the two. To achieve that effect in Snap<em>!</em>, before drawing the second circle, use the <img src="/img/1-introduction/set-transparency.png" title="set pen (transparency) to ()" alt="set pen (transparency) to ()" class="inline"/> block. A transparency of 0 means you see only the new color; a transparency of 100 means you see only the old color. In-between values determine which color is stronger in the overlapping area.
:::

Most of Kandinsky's circles are solid, but a few aren't. most notably the large white "halo" near the middle of the painting. His hollow circles don't have a constant width; if you want yours to look like his, change the pen size a little as you're drawing. But of course you don't have to make your art look exactly like his, nor exactly like the examples above. Use them for inspiration, but you're the artist.
