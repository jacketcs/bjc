<li>REVISION NOTE: Students EXTEND their <strong>list</strong> of nouns
as needed. At each testing stage, have them <strong>map</strong> their
"specialist block" or their <strong>plural </strong>block over the
entire list and note which words are and aren't correctly
pluralized.</li>

<li>Rebuild the images without white backgrounds. --MF</li>

<p>You can improve <code>plural</code> to work correctly with more
words. If the project is not already open, please reload it. (The

<strong>Abstraction: </strong> Make a
<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural_h.png" title="plural-h ()" alt="plural-h ()"/>
block that "specializes" on just one category, words that end with the
letter "h".

<ul>

<li>Start with a <code>list</code> of the words you want it to work
for.</li>

<li>This specialist block should work correctly for words that fit its
specialty

<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural_h-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" title="plural-h (mouse) reporting &apos;mousees&apos;" alt="plural-h (mouse) reporting &apos;mousees&apos;"/>

<code>plural-h</code> unless those words end with "h".</li>

<li>

with a variety of words to make sure it works the way you want. Then use

::: takeNote
<p><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Language often has special cases. In
English, the plurals of some nouns add "s"; some add "es"; nouns like
"calf" and "fly" become "calves" and "flies", changing their final
letters before adding "es". And more. For a programming task this
complex, it's (generally) best to break it into parts, handle each part
separately with its own procedure (its own block), and then have the
"top-level" block---in this case, <code>plural</code>, itself---use
those specialists. That is, instead of coding every little detail
directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and clearer to make
<code>plural</code> look something like this.<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural-abstract-definition.png" title="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s" alt="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s" class="indent noshadow"/></p>

<p>Showing<a name="abstraction" class="anchor">Â </a>the
<em>structure</em> of the method---just the overall strategy---in the
"top-level" block and leaving the details to separate blocks is one part
of an important computer science idea called <em>abstraction</em>.
Abstraction keeps your code clear, readable, and more easily debugged.
It will also help your code be more flexible.</p>
:::

<li>When you trust your new specialist block, edit <code> plural</code>
to use the specialist. Test (you can use <code>map</code>) to make sure
<code>plural</code> still works for all the words it used to work for,
as well as the new ones.</li>

<li>Create <code>plural-y</code> to handle words like
<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural_y-tray-with-result.png" title="plural-y (tray) reporting &apos;trays&apos;" alt="plural-y (tray) reporting &apos;trays&apos;"/>
and
<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural_y-sky-with-result.png" title="plural-y (sky) reporting &apos;skies&apos;" alt="plural-y (sky) reporting &apos;skies&apos;"/></li>

::: endnote
Remember, any specialist can make mistakes if it's asked to do a job
that isn't its specialty. For example:<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" title="plural-y (mouse) reporting &apos;mousies&apos;" alt="plural-y (mouse) reporting &apos;mousies&apos;" class="indent"/><br />
Make sure <code>plural</code> gives <code>plural-y</code> only words it
knows how to handle correctly.

I'm not thrilled with the way this pushes a particular implementation
for a reason that's hidden until they get there, and doesn't make sense
on its own. bh

<ol type="A">

<li>

Extend <code>plural</code> to correctly handle a input word that has a
space at the end.

::: endnote
<p>Right now, if <code>plural</code> is given a word with a space at the
end, it leaves that space in the plural:<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldog[space]s).png" title="plural (bulldog ) reporting &apos;bulldog s&apos;. There is a space after &apos;bulldog&apos; in the input and a space between &apos;bulldog&apos; and &apos;s&apos; in the reported value." alt="plural (bulldog ) reporting &apos;bulldog s&apos;. There is a space after &apos;bulldog&apos; in the input and a space between &apos;bulldog&apos; and &apos;s&apos; in the reported value." class="indent"/><br />
Figure out how to handle this special case and edit <code>plural</code>
so that the result is<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldogs).png" title="plural (bulldog ) reporting &apos;bulldogs&apos;. There is a space after &apos;bulldog&apos; in the input but no space in the reported value." alt="plural (bulldog ) reporting &apos;bulldogs&apos;. There is a space after &apos;bulldog&apos; in the input but no space in the reported value." class="indent"/><br />
You already have a block that <em>specializes</em> in making plurals of
words that <em>don't</em> have a space at the end. <em>Use</em> it.</p>
:::

<p>Surprise! Once <code>plural</code> works for a single space at the
end of a word, try giving it
<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[four-spaces].png" title="plural (bulldog  ). There iare six spaces after &apos;bulldog&apos; in the input." alt="plural (bulldog  ). There iare six spaces after &apos;bulldog&apos; in the input."/>.
That works too! But why?</p>

</li>

<li>

<img src="/img/icons/tough-stuff.png" title="Tough Stuff" alt="Tough Stuff" class="imageRight"/>
Does your <code>plurals</code> block still feel cluttered, even though
the details about how to handle each possible last letter are abstracted
into specialist blocks? One way to improve on this situation is to use
another kind of abstraction called <em>data-directed programming.</em>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>

Start by making a list of <em>key-value pairs</em>, with last letters as
the keys and specialist procedures as the values:<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural-specialists-list.png" title="set (plural specialists) to (list (list (h) (ringed plural-h ( ) block)) (list (y) (ringed plural-y ( ) block)) (list (f) (ringed plural-f ( ) block)) (list (x) (ringed (join ( ) (es)) block)) (list (...) (...)))" alt="set (plural specialists) to (list (list (h) (ringed plural-h ( ) block)) (list (y) (ringed plural-y ( ) block)) (list (f) (ringed plural-f ( ) block)) (list (x) (ringed (join ( ) (es)) block)) (list (...) (...)))" class="indent"/><br />

::: narrowpurple
To make the second item of each small list, find the block you want, put
it in the second input to <code>list</code>, then right-click on the
block and choose "ringify." As the "x" example shows, it doesn't have to
be a block named <code>plural-</code>something. It just has to have an
empty input slot where you want the word to go.

FYI, this breaks the rule of not teaching more than one thing at a time,
we are teaching key-value pairing, FIND FIRST, and CALL. As a result,
you've defaulted to hand-holding here. --MF, 1/11/21
:::

Then in your <code>plural</code> procedure, you can replace most of the
<code>if</code> blocks with<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/plural-specialist-dispatch.png" title="script variables (pair)
set (pair) to (find first item (ringed ((item (1) of ( )) = (last letter of (word)))) in (plural specialists))
if (is (pair) a (list)?) {
report (call (item (2) of (pair)) with inputs (word))
}" alt="script variables (pair)
set (pair) to (find first item (ringed ((item (1) of ( )) = (last letter of (word)))) in (plural specialists))
if (is (pair) a (list)?) {
report (call (item (2) of (pair)) with inputs (word))
}" class="indent"/><br />

We haven't taught FIND FIRST yet. So I looked at
<a href="/unit-3/lab-3/3-checking-for-ties.html">3.3.3</a>
where we first use it, and we don't teach it there either. :/ We
actually teach it in
<a href="/unit-5/lab-3/4-filtering-data.html">5.3.4</a>.
So I dragged some of that content back into U3 and also here. --MF,

:::

<p><code>Find first</code> is a higher-order function works similarly to
<code>keep</code>, but it reports only the first item that's found. It
is equivalent to <code>item (1) of (keep)</code>.</p>

::: commentBig
Ringifying is unclear here. What does it mean to have the ring? What
does it mean not to have it? If they don't know, they are "just doing
what the book says to." --MF, 1/11/21
:::

<p>The <code>call</code> block in the palette doesn't include the
"<code>with inputs</code>" in the picture; when you click on its right
arrowhead, those words will appear along with an input slot. The
<code>call</code> block's first input slot is the empty gray ring, which
means that <code>call</code> wants a block in that input slot. When you
drag <code>item 2 of pair</code> into that slot, the ring remains around
it. That's usually what we want when using <code>call</code>, but not
this time. Right-click on the <code>item of</code> block and choose
"unringify" from the menu.</p>

::: endnote
You can experiment with <code>call</code> to see what else you can do
with it. What happens if you don't unringify the <code>item</code>
block? What happens if you leave out the "<code>with inputs</code>" and
the second input?

::: comment
I think a hint here about testing all trailing substrings would be
helpful. Also, a definition of the term would be nice. --MF, 1/11/21
:::

There's no reason the keys have to be single letters. Modify the code in
<code>plural</code> so that it tests all <em>trailing substrings</em> of
the word against the specialist list. That is, if the word is "ditch,"
you'd look in the specialist list for "ditch," then for "itch," then
"tch," "ch," and finally, if nothing else is found, "h." You'd put<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/ch-dispatch.png" title="list (ch) (ringed block (join ( ) (es)))" alt="list (ch) (ringed block (join ( ) (es)))" class="indent"/><br />
in the list, and then words ending "ch" would have "es" added. This
mechanism is very general; it works even for special cases such as<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/child-dispatch.png" title="list (child) (ringified (word (children)))" alt="list (child) (ringified (word (children)))" class="indent"/><br />
(You'll have to define the <code>word</code> function that just reports
its input; it's needed because you can't type letters directly into a
ring.) <em>Now</em> you have a <em>really</em> uncluttered
<code>plural</code> block. And it'll even work for a language other than
English, if you make a different specialist list.

</li>

<li>

::: comment
Here is where you really start to lose me. I'm not actually building
this in Snap<em>!</em>now, as I've spent far too long on this already,
but the text doesn't explain this adequately for me. --MF, 1/11/21
:::

If you modify the trailing-substring test so that instead of giving up
if it can't find the last letter of the word as a key, it goes one step
further and looks for an <em>empty</em> key in the specialist list, and
you add<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/default-dispatch.png" title="(item ( ) (ringed (join ( ) (s))))" alt="(item ( ) (ringed (join ( ) (s))))" class="indent"/><br />
to the list, then you can be sure that every possible word will match
that, if nothing else, so you don't need the <code>if</code> any more.
Your <code>plural</code> block can now be just one-line: <code>report
(call (item 2 of (longest trailing substring ...</code>.

</li>

<li>For an extra challenge, modify your trailing-substring test so that
a plus sign in the key matches any vowel (it will serve as a wild-card
character), so you can do this:<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/match-vowels.png" title="list (...) (list (+y) (ringed (join ( ) (s)))) (list (y) (ringed (join (all but last letter of ( )) (ies)))) (...)" alt="list (...) (list (+y) (ringed (join ( ) (s)))) (list (y) (ringed (join (all but last letter of ( )) (ies)))) (...)" class="indent"/></li>
