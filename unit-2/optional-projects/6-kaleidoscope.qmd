**In this project,** you will build an app that lets you
draw like a kaleidoscope.<br />
<img src="/img/1-introduction/topic1-kaleidoscope.gif" alt="Kaleidoscope Activity" class="ms-4"/>
:::

One sprite is following the mouse. Three other sprites are reflecting
the movement of that sprite in slightly different ways.

<img src="/img/2-complexity/draggable-check-box.png" title="draggable box checked" alt="draggable box checked" class="float-end"/>
First, create and test code to make the first sprite follow the mouse
and draw a line tracing its path.

<ol>

<li>Use an <em>event</em> to trigger the kaleidoscope behavior so that
users don't have to open each sprite and click each script to start the
drawing.</li>

<li>Make the sprite draw only when the mouse is down (You'll need to
uncheck the "draggable" box so Snap<em>!</em> doesn't think you are
trying to drag the sprite when you click.)</li>

</ol>

You learned how to make the sprite follow the mouse in

detect an event on

1 Lab 1 Page 2: Programming a Game</a>. And you learned how draw only
when the mouse is down by using `if else` with `mouse
down?` in

Create a second sprite that mirrors the movement of the first one.

::: endnote
One way to create the second sprite is to duplicate the first one and
modify it. Right-click the sprite-button in the sprite corral (in the
lower right of the Snap<em>!</em> window), and select "duplicate" from
the context menu that appears. The new sprite will have the same scripts
as the original, which is why duplication is easier than creating new
sprites from scratch.

a hint about making the second sprite mirror the first one?</a>

::: {#hint-second-sprite .collapse}
You'll want the second sprite <em>either</em> to go to the same
<em>x</em>-position and the inverse <em>y</em>-position <em>or</em> to
go to the inverse <em>x</em>-position and the same
<em>y</em>-position.

<li>

Test your code and debug any problems.

::: endnote
You may wish to use an event (such a pressing the "c" key) to tell the
program to clear the stage and stop all scripts. This will make testing
and debugging easier.
:::

</li>

<li>

Create two more sprites that mirror the two you have.

::: endnote
If your second sprite mirrored the first horizontally, then the third
and fourth sprites should mirror those vertically, and vice versa.

Experiment with some of the following ideas, or make up your own changes
to the kaleidoscope.

Change the pens:

You learned about `set pen color` and `set pen
size` on

<li>Add some colors.</li>

<li>Adjust the pen sizes.</li>

Create more sprites:

<ul>

<li>Add new sprites that use `mouse x` as the <em>y</em>
input and `mouse y` as the <em>x</em> input.</li>

<li>Add new sprites that are shifted some distance away from another
sprite.</li>

</ul>

<li>Create variations of your own.</li>
