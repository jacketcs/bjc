PG: It's optional, but still feels like "why am I doing it?" "why is
it being suggested?" No obvious learning goal, even as an optional
project. But, fine, whatever, it's optional. PLEASE don't "trick your
friends to think...actually knows...truth." That is (to me) so
offensive, not to mention so unrealistic. And "have fun but please be
nice" is even more offensive. The first says the kid should not be
trustworthy, and the second says we don't trust the kid. Wow!

BH: Hints page.

MF: I made edits on 9/26/18 that need review; have they learned about
sound blocks (I don't think so)

**In this project,** you will build an automated fortune
telling program inspired by the <em>Magic 8 Ball</em><sup>®</sup> that
randomly offers answers to YES/NO questions. Click the video below to
watch the app in action.

<li>Create your own fortune-telling app. You can personalize it as you
like. For example, you might create your own messages.</li>

You may wish to look at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball" target="_blank" title="Magic 8-Ball">Wikipedia
entry for Magic 8 Ball</a><sup>®</sup> for some possible responses that
the app could give to a yes/no question. Notice that of the twenty
possible answers listed, ten are affirmative
([green]{style="color:green"}), five are non-committal
([yellow]{style="color: goldenrod"}), and five are negative
([red]{style="color:red"}).

Personalize your project; use other images for the costumes, and maybe
even add sounds.

You can import images and sound files from your desktop into your
project by dragging and dropping them into the Snap<em>!</em>

</li>

<li>Trick your friends into thinking that your automated fortune teller
actually knows things and tells the truth. Create a version of your
model that allows you to select among a certain type of choices when a
particular key is <em>secretly</em> pressed. For example, maybe when the
key "1" is pressed only affirmative answers are chosen, when the key "2"
is pressed only non-committal answers are chosen, when the key "3" is
pressed only negative answers are chosen.</li>
