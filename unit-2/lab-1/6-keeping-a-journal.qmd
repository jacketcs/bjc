**On this page,** you will begin using a journal to keep track of your programming insights.
:::

You can use a journal to <em>learn from your own programming</em>. The journal is just a notebook in which you write notes to yourself, like a diary. It's <em>for you,</em> not for your teacher.



Here are some ways to use your journal:

<ul>

<li>**When you learn a new idea** (not just the name of a Snap<em>!</em> block), make a note of it.</li>

<li>**When you make or discover a beautiful program**---a beautiful piece of code, or one that draws a beautiful picture---print it out, or take a photo, and add it to your journal.</li>

<li>

**When you find a bug** in your program, write down:

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>The symptom---How did you know there was a bug?</li>

<li>How you found the underlying problem---What steps did you take to find figure out what was going on?</li>

<li>The underlying problem---What <em>was</em> going on?</li>

<li>How you fixed it---Record anything that might be helpful next time you encounter a bug like this, or to help you avoid having a bug like this in the future.</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>**When something inspires you** to create a related program on your own, write down your idea for later.</li>

<li>

::: sidenote
This is just like recording bugs except that it's a bug in your understanding rather than a bug in your code.
:::

**When you're asked to predict what some script will do, and** your expectations turn out to be wrong, write down:

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>What you thought would happen</li>

<li>What actually happened</li>

<li>Why you thought what you thought</li>

<li>How you think about it now</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>**When the curriculum asks you to write** your ideas about something, write in your journal.</li>

</ul>
