<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you'll continue to develop your number guessing game to accept player guesses until the player guesses correctly.</p>
:::

<!--<div class="index-term" id="<code>repeat until</code> block" />-->

<p>You'll want the computer to ask players to guess again and again until they guess correctly. To do that, you will use the <img src="/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" title="repeat until" alt="repeat until" class="inline nopadtb"/> block. <code>Repeat until</code> is a <em>loop</em> (just like <code>repeat</code>, <code>forever</code>, and <code>for</code>) but also a <em>conditional</em> (like <code>if</code> and <code>if else</code>). It repeats until a certain condition is met. For this program, the code should repeat until the player's answer equals the secret number.</p>

Notice that the procedure

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">INPUT()</pre>
```
accepts the value from the user and returns that input value, which is then assigned to the variable

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">userResponse</pre>
```
with the

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">&leftarrow;</pre>
```
syntax. In Snap<em>!</em>, this is just like how <code>answer</code> accepts a value from the user and reports it, and that report is what the computer <code>set</code>s the variable <var>user response</var> to.

<p>The word Boolean is capitalized because it's named after a person, George Boole, who invented the branch of mathematics dealing with Boolean operations (such as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>).</p>

<p>A <strong>predicate</strong> is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question such as these examples:<br /> 7 reporting true" title="8 \> 7 reporting true" /\> 7 reporting false" title="6 \> 7 reporting false" /\></p>

::: todo
We really shouldn't be encouraging students to mutate a block's inputs. There are really two issues here; one is with the x=x+1 style of programming altogether, and the second is that formal parameters specifically shouldn't generally be mutated; it's better to make a script variable that's initialized to the input value. (If we change this, we need to update the Guided Notes.) --MF, 6/26/21 with BH

Correct! No matter what the input number is (as long as it's an integer), the report block will eventually run. (This doesn't necessarily happen in every procedure, but here it will.)

Write out some examples of what happens when the input is less than 5. For example, if the input is 3, the sprite will say 3, the input will be changed to 4, the sprite will say 4, the input will be changed to 5, the <code>repeat until</code> loop will stop, and the function will report "finished."

Correct! The <code>repeat until</code> block runs the code in its script slot <strong>until</strong> <var>input</var> = 5, then the computer skips down to the next command, <code>report (</code><var>finished</var><code>)</code>, without the sprite ever saying 5.
