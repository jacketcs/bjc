:::::: learn
In Click Alonzo, the game switched back and forth between two different versions of the Alonzo costume in order to tell the player whether they successfully clicked Alonzo. **On this page,** you will allow the user of your Click Alonzo program to choose the sprite's costume.

You learned how to add costumes on <a href="/unit-1/lab-2/3-customizing.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 3: Customizing and Debugging">Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 3: Customizing and Debugging</a>.
::::

(@) If it isn't open already, open your U2L1-ClickAlonzo project.

(@) Set up what you need for this new version:
    a. Add several costumes.
    b. Delete the backwards-Alonzo costume.
    c. Remove the code in the program that changes the costume when you click the sprite.

(@) Experiment with the <img src="/img/blocks/switch-to-costume.png" title="switch to costume []" alt="switch to costume []" class="inline py-0"/> block using different inputs to switch the sprite's costume manually a few times.

::::::

:::::: takeNote
If <em>you're</em> playing your game and you want to change the costume, you can just choose the costume you want by name, in the `switch to costume` block's pulldown menu. But imagine you're giving this game to a non-programmer friend to play. You want to <em>program</em> the selection of a new costume inside the game, so your friend doesn't have to know anything about blocks.
::::::

When you used `item of` before (for example, inside `who` and `does what`) , you were accessing items of the list <em>randomly</em>. But you can also select a specific item by specifying its <em>position</em>.

:::::: vocabFullWidth
: **Index**

The position number is called the **index** of the item in the list. <br /> <img src="/img/3-lists/item-2-of-list-reporting.png" title="item (2) of (list (apple) (cantaloupe) (banana)) reporting &apos;cantaloupe&apos;" alt="item (2) of (list (apple) (cantaloupe) (banana)) reporting &apos;cantaloupe&apos;" class="ms-4"/><br /> In this list, 1 is the index of the item "apple," 2 is the index of the item "cantaloupe," and so on.

In Snap<em>!</em> and on the AP exam, the index is always a whole number (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). It is an error to use an index less than 1 or greater than the length of the list.
::::::

Lists can contain anything: letters or words, costumes, other lists, or even blocks. You can use `my` to report a list of the costumes for your sprite.<br />

:::::: sidenote
The `my` block looks like <img src="/img/blocks/my-neighbors.png" title="my (neighbors)" alt="my (neighbors)" class="inline"/> until you select "costumes" from its drop-down menu.
::::::

<img src="/img/2-complexity/my-costumes-reporting.png" title="my (costumes) reporting a list of three costumes: a girl with an afro, a penguin, and a unicorn" alt="my (costumes) reporting a list of three costumes: a girl with an afro, a penguin, and a unicorn" class="ms-4"/>

And you can use `item of` together with `my` to select a costume in a specific position in the list.

:::::: endnote
Some blocks (such as `item of`) have input slots that expect a list. You can tell because the input slot looks kind of like a list:<br /> <img src="/img/blocks/item.png" title="item (1) of &apos;list input slot&apos;" alt="item (1) of &apos;list input slot&apos;" class="ms-4"/> <img src="/img/2-complexity/listpic.png" alt="picture of 2-item list" class="ms-4"/>

(@) Practice using the <em>index</em> of the costumes in your list to switch the sprite's costume a few times.

    :::: narrower
    You can drag blocks into the input slot of `switch to costume` even though it's a drop-down menu.<br /> <img src="/img/blocks/switch-to-costume.png" title="switch to costume []" alt="switch to costume []" class="ms-4"/> <img src="/img/2-complexity/switch-to-costume(item-of).png" title="switch to costume (item (1) of &apos;list input slot&apos;)" alt="switch to costume (item (1) of &apos;list input slot&apos;)" class="ms-4"/>

You used `ask` and `answer` on <a href="/unit-2/lab-1/2-checking-player-guess.html" title="">Unit 2 Lab 1 Page 2: Checking the Player's Guess</a>.
::::

(@) Modify your code so the player can select the sprite costume:
    a. Use a <var>costumes</var> script variable to store the list of sprite costumes.
    b. Use <img src="/img/blocks/show-variable-full-size.png" title="show variable []" alt="show variable []" class="inline py-0"/> to show the contents of that variable.<
    c. `Ask` the player "Which costume number do you want?"
    d. Change to the costume with the index number in the player's `answer`.
    e. Hide the costume list.

The list expression <img src="/img/2-complexity/item-2-of-costumes.png" title="item (2) of (costumes)" alt="item (2) of (costumes)" class="inline"/> would be written as
<pre class="inline">costumes[2]</pre>
