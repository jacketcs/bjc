**In this lab,** you will use local and global <em>variables</em> to store information. 

To learn how to do this, you will create a number guessing game where the user's goal is to guess a number randomly generated by the computer.

You will also extend your Click Alonzo work from Unit 1, Lab 1 to use variable to store the score.
