The <code>mod</code> block <strong>reports the remainder</strong> when
the first input is divided by the second. For example,
<img src="/img/1-introduction/17-mod-5.png" title="(17) mod (5)" alt="(17) mod (5)"/>
reports 2 because when 17 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2. When one
number divides another evenly, the remainder is 0. So for example,
<img src="/img/1-introduction/15-mod-5.png" title="(15) mod (5)" alt="(15) mod (5)"/>
reports 0.

Different programming languages have different ways of handling negative
inputs to the mod function. So you won't see any negative numbers used
with mod on the exam.
:::

<strong>The <code>mod</code> operator:</strong> The expression
<img src="/img/1-introduction/17-mod-5.png" title="(17) mod (5)" alt="(17) mod (5)" class="inline nopadtb"/>
would be written as

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">17 MOD 5</pre>
```
on the exam. If you see an expression with variables as input to
<code>mod</code>, such as

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">a MOD b</pre>
```
, you can assume that <var>a</var> is zero or positive, and <var>b</var>
is strictly positive (because you can't divide by 0).

On the exam, you may see these four arithmetic operators:

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">+</pre>
```
,

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">-</pre>
```
,

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">*</pre>
```
,

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">/</pre>
```
(plus, minus, times, divide) as well as

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">MOD</pre>
```
. Arithmetic operators are part of most programming languages. (Most
text languages use

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">*</pre>
```
rather than

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">&times;</pre>
```
for multiplication because

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">&times</pre>
```
isn't on most keyboards, and because it looks too much like the letter
x.)

<strong>Order of operations:</strong> In a block language, the nesting
of blocks determines the order of operations. For example, in
<img src="/img/6-computers/3-times(5+4).png" title="3 × (5 + 4)" alt="3 × (5 + 4)" class="inline nopadtb"/>
you can <em>see</em> that the <code>+</code> block is an input to the
<code>×</code> block, so the expression means 3×(5+4). Similarly,
<img src="/img/6-computers/(3-times-5)+4.png" title="(3 × 5) + 4" alt="(3 × 5) + 4" class="inline nopadtb"/>
means (3×5)+4. In Snap<em>!</em>, it's as if there are parentheses
around <em>every</em> operation. But in text languages, you can write

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">3 * 4 + 5</pre>
```
without parentheses, so they need the rules you learn in math class
(multiplication before addition, and so on). The <code>mod</code>
operator is like multiplication and division; it happens <em>before</em>
addition and subtraction. So for example,

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">7 + 5 MOD 2 - 6</pre>
```
means

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">7 + 1 - 6</pre>
```
, which is, of course, 2.

<p>Katherine Johnson (1918--2020) was an aerospace technologist with a
Ph.D. in mathematics who worked for NASA calculating the motion of
spacecraft. Johnson, originally hired as a human computer, verified the
calculations of digital computers, helped calculate the trajectory of
Apollo 11 (the first time humans walked on the Moon), worked on plans
for a mission to Mars, and encouraged students to pursue careers in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>
