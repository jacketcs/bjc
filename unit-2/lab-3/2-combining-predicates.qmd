**On this page**, you will combine predicates using Boolean functions to write on the stage in three colors.

## Boolean Functions

At the very lowest level, computer circuitry is made of wires, and each wire is either on or off. So the only operations that can be performed at that lowest level are those that <em>operate on single-bit values</em> (just ones and zeros, that is, just ons and offs). These are called <em>logical (or Boolean) functions</em>. (They're predicates, because their range is Booleans, but these are special in that their <em>domain</em> is also Booleans.) There are three Boolean functions in the Operators palette:<br /> <img src="/img/prog/Booleans.png" title="and, or, not blocks" alt="and, or, not blocks" class="ms-4"/><br />



Notice that both the blocks themselves and the input slots in the blocks are hexagonal. Boolean functions take Boolean values (`True` or `False`) as inputs and report a new Boolean value as output. When you use Boolean functions in a program, though, the inputs will usually be expressions such as <img src="/img/2-complexity/var=3.png" title="variable = 3" alt="variable = 3"/>.



::: forYouToDo

(@) Experiment with different input values in all three blocks, and take notes about the results you get.

    :::: endnote
    Instead of dragging a `true` or `false` block into the input slot of an `and`, `or`, or `not` block, you can click the empty input slot to control a `true`/`false` toggle: <img src="/img/2-complexity/true-and-false.png" title="(true) and (false)" alt="(true) and (false)" class="inline"/>
    ::::

:::

The `and` and `not` blocks work exactly the way you'd expect from the meanings of those words in English:

<ul>



<li><img src="/img/2-complexity/true-and-true.png" title="(true) and (true)" alt="(true) and (true)"/> reports `true`, and any other combination of inputs reports `false`.</li>



<li><img src="/img/blocks/not.png" title="not ()" alt="not ()"/> reports the opposite of whichever input value you use.</li>

</ul>



But `or` is a little different in computer science. In English, the word "or" has two different meanings:

<ul>

<li>**Either but not both:** such as "Let's check whether it will be rainy or sunny tomorrow." In computer science, this is called <em>exclusive or</em> because one option excludes the other.</li>

<li>**Either or both:** such as "Ask your teacher if you have any questions or if you need help." This is called <em>inclusive or</em> because it's possible for both options to be included.</li>

</ul>



::: forYouToDo

(@) Experiment. Does the <img src="/img/blocks/or.png" title="() or ()" alt="() or ()"/> block implement <em>exclusive</em> or <em>inclusive</em> `or`?

<li>

Because there are only two Boolean values (`true` and `false`), there are only four combinations of inputs for a two-input Boolean operator. Here are the four combinations shown with the `or` operator:<br /> <img src="/img/2-complexity/or-t-t.png" alt="or (true) (true)" class="ms-4"/><br /> <img src="/img/2-complexity/or-t-f.png" alt="or (true) (false)" class="ms-4"/><br /> <img src="/img/2-complexity/or-f-t.png" alt="or (false) (true)" class="ms-4"/><br /> <img src="/img/2-complexity/or-f-f.png" alt="or (false) (false)" class="ms-4"/>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>With `or`, the four combinations report `true`, `true`, `true`, and `false` in that order. (Check for yourself that this is true.) So, you can represent the `or` function as TTTF (using T and F as abbreviations for `true` and `false`). What are the four letters for the `and` function? (Assume the same ordering of the inputs: TT, TF, FT, and FF as shown above with `or`.)</li>

<li>

Make up another set of four letters (such as TFTF), and build a predicate function with that behavior. Describe how the function behaves.

It's not a useful function because you could just use the second input as the predicate instead of building this predicate function.
