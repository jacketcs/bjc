**On this page,** you will match Boolean expressions
with the pictures they help create.

    Read this script carefully, discuss it with your partner, and make sure
    you understand why it produces this picture on the stage:<br />
    <img src="/img/2-complexity/dotscript.png" title="clear
    pen up
    forever {
    go to (random position)
    if (x position &lt; y position) {
    set pen color to purple
    } else {
    set pen color to orange
    }
    make a point
    }" alt="clear
    pen up
    forever {
    go to (random position)
    if (x position &lt; y position) {
    set pen color to purple
    } else {
    set pen color to orange
    }
    make a point
    }" class="ms-4"/>
    <img src="/img/2-complexity/y-gtr-x.png" title=" Imagine a 45-degree line sloping upward toward the right, through the center of the stage. The area up and to the left of this line is purple; the area below and to the right is orange." alt=" Imagine a 45-degree line sloping upward toward the right, through the center of the stage. The area up and to the left of this line is purple; the area below and to the right is orange." class="ms-4"/></li>

(@) Changing the Boolean expression in the `if` block changes
the picture. Discuss why the expression <img src="/img/2-complexity/apple-script.png" alt="(x position > 0) and (distance to apple > 100)" title="(x position > 0) and (distance to apple > 100)">
generates this picture:

    <img src="/img/2-complexity/apple.png" title="There&apos;s an apple in the center. The entire left half of the stage is orange; so is a circle around the apple. What&apos;s left is purple." alt="There&apos;s an apple in the center. The entire left half of the stage is orange; so is a circle around the apple. What&apos;s left is purple." class="ms-4"/></li>

(@) Match the Boolean expressions with the pictures. There are more
expressions than pictures.<br />

with pictures in the previous problem (without using
