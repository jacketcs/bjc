**On this page**, you will use predicates with the `keep` block to keep items in a list that have specific characteristics.
:::

As you know, predicates can be used with conditionals to decide <em>when</em> to <em>do</em> something; they can also be used with `keep` to decide <em>which</em> things to keep. The <img src="/img/blocks/keep.png" title="keep items &apos;predicate input slot&apos; from &apos;list input slot&apos;" alt="keep items &apos;predicate input slot&apos; from &apos;list input slot&apos;" class="inline"/> block takes a list and a predicate as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the input list that make the condition described by the predicate true.

For example, the following expression will find words from the <var>words list</var> whose first letter is v. The <em>blank input slot</em> is where each item of the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br> <img src="/img/2-complexity/keep-example-6.png" title="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)" alt="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)" class="ms-4"/>

: **String** and **Index**

<ul>



<li>A **string** is an ordered sequence of characters.</li>



<li><a href="/unit-2/lab-2/2-quizzes.html" title="You've already learned the word index">You've already learned</a> the word **index** for the position of an element in a list. The same word is used for the position of a character in a string (for example, a letter in a word). So the first input to `letter` is the index.</li>

</ul>
:::

::: takeNote
**You write the predicate that does the checking, and `keep` applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate `true`**.

Note that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em>; this is where each item from the list goes as it is checked by the predicate.

::: endnote
The `letter` block in the palette looks like <img src="/img/blocks/letter-1-of-world.png" title="letter (1) of (world)" alt="letter (1) of (world)"/>. You have to delete the "world" so that there is a blank slot where you need it to be.

This project contains two example `keep` expressions and an `initialize list` procedure (you can look inside it to see what it does).

<li><img src="/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner" alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline"/> Experiment with these examples of `keep`. Discuss and then explain <em>in writing</em> what these expressions are doing.<br /> <img src="/img/2-complexity/keep-example-4.png" title="keep items  ((length of ( )) = (5)) from {apple, banana, orange, grape, kiwi, mango, watermelon} reporting {apple, grape, mango}" alt="keep items  ((length of ( )) = (5)) from {apple, banana, orange, grape, kiwi, mango, watermelon} reporting {apple, grape, mango}" class="ms-4"/><br /> <img src="/img/2-complexity/keep-example-7.png" title="keep items  (not(is () a (number)?)) from {5, :), six, 7, elephant, 3} reporting {5,7,3}" alt="keep items  (not(is () a (number)?)) from {5, :), six, 7, elephant, 3} reporting {5,7,3}" class="ms-4"/></li>

</ol>
:::

The first example keeps inputs of a certain <em>length</em>; every word in the list is asked whether its length is 5, and only those with five letters are reported. The second example keeps inputs that are <em>not numbers</em>; every item in this list is asked "Is this item <em>not</em> a number?" and only the elements that are not numbers are reported.

There are two `length` blocks in Snap<em>!</em>. One (<img src="/img/blocks/length-of-blank-operator.png" title="length ()" alt="length ()" class="inline"/>) is designed for strings, and the other (<img src="/img/blocks/length-list.png" title="length ()" alt="length ()" class="inline"/>) is designed for lists.

<ol start="3">

<li>

If you don't see a list of words on the stage, run `initialize list`. Then use `keep` to answer these questions:

<ol>

<li>How many 12-letter words are in <var>words list</var>?</li>

<li>How many 15-letter words are in <var>words list</var>?</li>

<li>How many 17-letter words are in <var>words list</var>?</li>

</ol>
