<p>Nobody would have to ask a computer "Does spaghetti have 5 letters?"
The block should be retitled WORD ( ) HAS ( ) LETTERS so that it looks
more sensible. --bh</p>

<p>Then chase the change forward into 5.1 starting on page 2, editing
started files, solutions, and TG in both units as needed. --MF,

<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will solve a crossword puzzle by
combining predicates using the <code>and</code> block. You will then use
the resulting predicates with <code>keep</code> to find words with
specific characteristics.</p>

<li>

You have used the
<img src="/img/blocks/length-of-blank-operator.png" title="length of ()" alt="length of ()" class="inline"/>
block in the Operators palette together with <code>=</code> and
<code>keep</code> to find words of a certain length in the <var>words
list</var>.

<ol>

<li>Reassemble that script so that you can find all the words that have
8 letters.</li>

<li>Find all the words that have 11 letters.</li>

<li>You now have an <em>expression</em> that you can edit to test any
word for any number of letters. This is a useful tool to have. Create
and test a predicate <em>block</em> that takes a word and number as
input and works like this:<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/does-orange-6-letters-true.png" title="does (orange) have (6) letters? reporting true" alt="does (orange) have (6) letters? reporting true" class="indent"/>
<img src="/img/2-complexity/does-apple-7-letters-false.png" title="does (apple) have (7) letters? reporting false" alt="does (apple) have (7) letters? reporting false" class="indent"/></li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>

Build an <em>expression</em> using the
<img src="/img/blocks/letter-blank-of-blank.png" title="letter () of ()" alt="letter () of ()" class="inline"/>
block with <code>=</code> and <code>keep</code> to find words that have
certain letters in certain places.

<ol>

<li>Use it to find all the words that begin with the letter i.</li>

<li>Find all the words whose fourth letter is r.</li>

::: sidenote
Your block's title can be different from the one shown here as long as
it does the same job.
:::

<li>If you have not yet turned your expression into a predicate
<em>block</em>, do that now. Your block should work like this: <br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/is-letter-4-of-carrot-o-reporting-false.png" title="is letter (4) of (carrot) the letter (o)? reporting false" alt="is letter (4) of (carrot) the letter (o)? reporting false" class="indent"/>

<strong>Work with another pair.</strong> Use your predicates, along with
<code>and</code> and <code>keep</code>, to solve

Can we hint this?

For example, this expression searches for 6 letter words that start with
<var>r</var> and have <var>d</var> as the third letter:

<ol type="A">

<li>

Create and test a predicate block that checks whether a certain letter
is in a word. Examples below. Your block should:

<ul>

<li>Accept two inputs: a <var>letter</var> to check for and a
<var>word</var>, and</li>

<li>Report whether or not the input <var>word</var> has the input
<var>letter</var>.</li>

</ul>

Create this block:<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/pattern-matcher.png" title="words matching (-e-u--c--g) from (word list)" alt="words matching (-e-u--c--g) from (word list)" class="indent"/><br />
The first input is a <em>pattern,</em> which is a word in which some of
the letters have been replaced by hyphens (minus
signs).<!--  The hard part will be to write a helper<br />
<img src="/img/2-complexity/does-word-match-pattern.png" alt="does word (foo) match pattern (f-o) ?" title="does word (foo) match pattern (f-o) ?"><br />
that checks whether each letter in the pattern is either the same as the corresponding letter of the input word or a hyphen. --></li>
