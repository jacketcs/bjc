<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will create tools for storing and accessing data.</p>

<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a shopping list app.</p>

Some programming languages use the word <em>array</em> instead of <em>list</em>.
:::

<p>Many computer applications---contact lists, playlists, calendars, reminders---involve manipulating <em>lists</em> of information using tools that search, sort, or change the items on the list. You've worked with lists before as you customized the gossip project.<br /></p>

The list expression <img src="/img/1-introduction/list-from-who.png" title="list{Señora, Ms. C, my cat, Hannah, Jake}" alt="list{Señora, Ms. C, my cat, Hannah, Jake}" class="inline"/> would be written as

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">[Señora, Ms. C, my cat, Hannah, Jake]</pre>
```
. The items are positioned in the list in the order they appear in the text: "Señora" has index 1, "Ms. C" has index 2, and so on.

Initialize a <var>shopping list</var> variable to store the information.

<ol>

<li>Make a global variable called <var>shopping list</var>.</li>

<li>

Set <var>shopping list</var> to an <em>empty</em> list (a list with nothing in it). You will need a <img src="/img/blocks/list-full-size.png" title="list ()" alt="list ()" class="inline"/> block.

::: narrower
Use its left arrow to get rid of the input slot so that it looks like this: <img src="/img/blocks/empty-list-block.png" title="list" alt="list"/>. That way, you will have an empty list rather than a list with one empty item.

##Adding Items to a List

<p>

::: vocabBig
::: commentBig
AAP-1.C.2
:::

<p>An <strong>element</strong> is another name for an item in a list. (If the same value is in the list twice, that counts as two different elements.) Each element has a unique <em>index</em> (position) in the list.</p>
:::

You can use the <img src="/img/blocks/insert.png" title="insert (thing) at (1) of &apos;list input slot&apos;" alt="insert (thing) at (1) of &apos;list input slot&apos;" class="inline"/> or <img src="/img/blocks/add.png" title="add (thing) to &apos;list input slot&apos;" alt="add (thing) to &apos;list input slot&apos;" class="inline"/> block to add elements to a list.

<ul>

<li><code>Insert</code> puts the new item <em>before</em> the place you specify.</li>

<li><code>Add</code> puts the item <em>after</em> the last existing item.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you run this script in Snap<em>!</em>, the second line of code assigns to <var>shopping list 2</var> the value of <var>shopping list</var> (that is, the same list, not a copy). So, the third line of code modifies <em>both</em> variables: <br /> <img src="/img/2-complexity/example-list-by-reference.png" title="set(shopping list) to (list(apple)(banana))
set(shopping list 2) to (shopping list)
add (carrot) to (shopping list)" alt="set(shopping list) to (list(apple)(banana))

add (carrot) to (shopping list)" class="indent"/> <img src="/img/2-complexity/example-list-by-reference-stage.png" title="shopping list watcher showing the contents of the variable to be apple, banana, carrot; and the shopping list 2 watcher showing the contents of the variable to be apple, banana, carrot" alt="shopping list watcher showing the contents of the variable to be apple, banana, carrot; and the shopping list 2 watcher showing the contents of the variable to be apple, banana, carrot" class="indent"/><br /></p>

However on the exam, the statement

```{=html}
<pre class="inline">shoppingList2 &leftarrow; shoppingList</pre>
```
makes a <em>copy</em> of the list. So modifying one of them <em>does not</em> modify the other.

<p>The rules for how to use lists and how they behave differ depending on the programming language you are using.</p>
