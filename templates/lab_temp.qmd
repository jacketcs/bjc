::: learn
Create a red box by using the `learn` tag after enclosing the section with `:::`. `:::` is just Quarto markdown specific syntax to create a `<div>`
:::

::: forYouToDo
`forYouToDo` places the section in the green outline "for students to do".
:::

`forYouToDo`, `ifTime`, `dialogue`, `takeItFurther`, `takeNote`, `endnote`, `narrower`, `narrowblue`, `narrowpurple`, `time`, `learn` are all possible classes for you to use for the `div`s

Besides things copied directly from BJC such as the original HTML code, we should try to use [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for things like creating lists, links, images, etc. Unless the Markdown syntax prevents us from adding a feature, this is what I recommend.

We can add a slide by creating a separate `qmd` file in the same directory as lab that we want it on (create a `steps` folder and place all slides in that folder; files should be named simply so that we can know which page they belong to, see unit-1, lab-1 for an example)

This is how we can embed the slide in.

```{=html}
<iframe class="slide-deck" src="steps/slide_temp.html"></iframe>
```

Notice how we can use the relative address of the file and that we have to explicitly use `.html` instead of the source file that is actually `.qmd`. (So, always create a `.qmd` file and if you're adding it as a slide, say it's `.html` when you're embedding it)
