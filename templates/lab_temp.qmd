::: learn
Create a red box by using the `learn` tag after enclosing the section with `:::`. `:::` is just Quarto markdown specific syntax to create a `<div>`
:::

::: forYouToDo
`forYouToDo` places the section in the green outline "for students to do".
:::

`forYouToDo`, `ifTime`, `dialogue`, `takeItFurther`, `takeNote`, `endnote`, `narrower`, `narrowblue`, `narrowpurple`, `time`, `learn` are all possible classes for you to use for the `div`s

Besides things copied directly from BJC such as the original HTML code, we should try to use [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for things like creating lists, links, images, etc. Unless the Markdown syntax prevents us from adding a feature, this is what I recommend.
