::: {.learn}
In this project, you'll create a game that teaches the history of computers, based off what you learned in this unit and self-research.
:::

Recall that from Unit 6, we touched on the history of computers in [Lab 2](/unit-6/lab-2/1-timeline.qmd). Now it's time for you to create a game that can teach someone about the history of computers.

::: {.forYouToDo}
1. ***BEFORE YOU DO YOUR ACTUAL CODING***, Create a write-up detailing your ideas for how to code the project for each event/interaction and outline for the game.
- Requirements:
* Reference specific blocks and solutions for your code (e.g. Will you use a list? What blocks will you create and what will they do? Which built-in blocks will you think can help you create a specific portion of the project?)
* Written in a logical order.
* At least 1000 words.
- **Due on Friday, 5/19/2023.**
- A template for this write-up is in your Google Classroom assignment.

2. Create a game (the design is up to you!) where the user is either asked computer history trivia questions, or interesting facts about computer history are presented as the game is played. **The game cannot be just a [quiz game like we did in U2L2](/unit-2/lab-2/2-quizzes.qmd)**. There must be some sort of sprite movement and either dexterity, accuracy, and/or problem-solving challenge apart from answering questions. 
- The requirements for this game will be to:
* Have creative and artistic value by having relevant sprite costumes involved in the project.
* From the various events listed on [Unit 6, Lab 2, Page 1](/unit-6/lab-2/1-timeline.qmd), use at least 5 of the events.
* In addition, find and research two other events that are **not listed** on [Unit 6, Lab 2, Page 1](/unit-6/lab-2/1-timeline.qmd) to add to your project. Do your own research on what you think was a "ground-breaking" or important development.
- **At least one of these must be a development from the last 3 years.**
- **Due halfway through the finals period (Wednesday 5/31 for Period 4 and Thursday 6/1 for Periods 5 and 6.** The second half of the finals period will be to showcase your projects and/or party time.

:::

**This final project is worth *50 points* on your project/assessment grade.**
