In this project, you'll create a game that teaches the history of computers, based off what you learned in this unit and self-research.
:::

Recall that from Unit 6, we touched on the history of computers in [Lab 2](/unit-6/lab-2/1-timeline.qmd). Now it's time for you to create a game that can teach someone about the history of computers.

::: {.forYouToDo}

Create a game (the design is up to you!) where the user is either asked computer history trivia questions, or interesting facts about computer history are presented as the game is played. **The game cannot be just a [quiz game like we did in U2L2](/unit-2/lab-2/2-quizzes.qmd)**. There must be some sort of sprite movement and either dexterity, accuracy, and/or problem-solving challenge apart from answering questions. 

- The requirements for this game will be to:

    * Have creative and artistic value by having relevant sprite costumes involved in the project.
    * From the various events listed on [Unit 6, Lab 2, Page 1](/unit-6/lab-2/1-timeline.qmd), use at least 5 of the events.
    * In addition, find and research two other events that are **not listed** on [Unit 6, Lab 2, Page 1](/unit-6/lab-2/1-timeline.qmd) to add to your project. Do your own research on what you think was a "ground-breaking" or important development. (**At least one of these must be a development from the last 3 years.**)

- **Due halfway through the finals period (Wednesday 5/29 for Period 1 and 2, Thursday 5/30 for Period 3 and 4, and Friday 5/31 for Periods 5 and 6.** The second half of the finals period will be to showcase your projects and/or party time.

- **Alternative Route**: If you are interested, you can instead create an equivalent project using [Unit 6, Lab 1](/unit-6/lab-1/01-abstraction.qmd). You must use at least 8 of the abstraction layers presented in this lab (i.e. at least 7 of the pages) in lieu of the 5 + 2 historical computer science events.
