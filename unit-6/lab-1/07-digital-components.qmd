what's important and on the AP exam: processor, memory, I/O.</p>

<strong>On this page</strong>, you'll explore the <em>parts</em>
(components) of the computer hardware.
:::

<p>For as long as people have been teaching other people about
computers, they always say "A computer consists of the processor,
memory, and input/output (I/O) devices."</p>

<p>In the early days of computers, it was easy to point out the huge
racks of equipment that contained each of those three components:<br />
<img src="/img/6-computers/pdp-10.jpg" title="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Processor and Memory" alt="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Processor and Memory" class="indent" width="400px"/>
<img src="/img/6-computers/pdp-10-disks.jpg" title="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Magnetic tape drives, disk drives, and other I/O devices" alt="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Magnetic tape drives, disk drives, and other I/O devices" class="inline" width="360px"/></p>

<p>These are pictures of a powerful computer from the 1970s. Each of the
big racks full of circuitry is about the size of a refrigerator. Today,
a much more powerful computer---more speed, more memory---fits inside a
cell phone.</p>

<p>Because today's processors and memory are so small, most of what we
see is the <strong>input/output (I/O)</strong> devices, like keyboard,
mouse, screens. <em>Input</em> devices include the keyboard, mouse, and
microphone. <em>Output</em> devices include the printer, speaker, and
(for laptop or desktop computers) the display screen. On phones and
tablets, touchscreens are used for both input and output. Disk drives,
optical drives (for CDs and DVDs), and the Internet interface are also
used for both.</p>

is it called <em>motherboard</em>?</a>

::: {#hint-target .collapse}
In a desktop computer, there are other boards too---the Ethernet port,
"serial" ports for the keyboard and mouse, and other expansion
cards---and <strong>all the other boards plug into the
motherboard</strong>. In laptops, there isn't room for many other
boards, and there is <em>no</em> room for boards perpendicular to the
motherboard, but we still use the same name.

Imagine you are buying a new computer. In a group of four, have each
person choose <em>one</em> of these reasons:<br />

<ol start="a">

<li>Mainly for reading email and surfing web pages (but <em>not</em>
watching many movies).</li>

<li>Mainly for playing online video games.</li>

<li>Mainly for storing your photos and music.</li>

<li>Mainly for streaming online movies.</li>

</ol>

Assume you each want the least expensive computer that does a great job
for your purpose. <strong>Research what features of the computer are
most important for your purpose, choose a computer, and compare notes
with the rest of the group.</strong> Which computer is most expensive?
Least expensive? Did you choose a laptop or a desktop, and why?

Things you might think about as you design your program:

<ol type="a">

<li>How will the computer ask questions? Will the program choose
randomly from component list?</li>

<li>How will the player answer? Will they click a number on the stage to
answer?</li>

<li>How will the program treat player mistakes? Can they try again
immediately? Will they move on and repeat later? Or will they have no
further chance?</li>

<li>Decide whether to keep score and, if so, how to do it.</li>

<li>Decide whether to keep track of what's been asked so the components
don't repeat and, if so, how to do it.</li>

<li>Decide when to end the game and what to do then.</li>
