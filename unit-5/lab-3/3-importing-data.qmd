Computers can be useful in processing data to gain information, but
your ability process data depends both on your capabilities and the
tools you have available.

**On this page**, you will build various tools
(specifically, selectors) to help you answer questions about data that
interests you.

You may be familiar with tables from spreadsheet applications (such as
Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, or Microsoft Excel) which store tabular
data in different file formats. Spreadsheet programs help efficiently
organize information, and they can find trends in data automatically
(such as the line shown at right). CSV is an open spreadsheet format
that works in any of these applications and in Snap<em>!</em>.

::: endnote
<a href="#hint-CSV" data-bs-toggle="collapse" title="What does CSV stand for">What
does CSV stand for?</a>

::: {#hint-CSV .collapse}
CSV stands for "comma separated values." CSV files are tables of data
stored with commas between each item in a row and line breaks between
each row in the table. (You can see the commas and line breaks of a CSV
by opening it in a text editor.)
:::
:::

Although spreadsheets are a common kind of data, they aren't the only
kind. Consider the list of words that you used in Lab 1 to check
spelling. It's not a <em>list of lists</em> with two dimensions of data
(rows and columns); it's just a <em>list</em> with one dimension of
data. "Spreadsheet" refers to two-dimensional data organized in rows and
columns. "Dataset" is the more general term for <em>any</em> collection
of data, including simple, one-dimensional lists; spreadsheets
(two-dimensional lists of lists); and more complicated datasets such as
spreadsheets with multiple tabs.

`Record` and `column` are <em>selectors</em>
for a `table` abstract data type. We don't need a
<em>constructor</em> for this abstract data type because we are
importing the data from the Internet, but the selectors will be useful.
(`Field` is a selector for `record`, which is,
itself, an abstract data type.)

Notice that these suggested block names include the word "table" or
"record" before the second input. Including the expected input data type
in the block name can help you avoid bugs caused by using a selector
that doesn't match the input you want to use.

<h3>Challenges in Collecting Data</h3>

::: todo
This section <em>looks</em> long. We should do another pass to trim it
down. --MF, 4/4/20

:::

Researchers often face challenges with data before they even begin
analysis. Suppose you are combining data from different countries about
distances between cities, and you discover that the distance data from
the U.S. is measured in miles, but the distance data from Europe is
measured in kilometers; to make meaningful comparisons, you need
<em>uniform</em> data (all in miles or all in kilometers). As another
example, if you use an online survey to collect data, the way
participants abbreviate, spell, or capitalize their entries may vary.
Data may also be incomplete (if some people didn't complete the survey)
or invalid (if some people made mistakes).

::: vocabFullWidth
::: ap-standard
DAT-2.C.4, DAT-2.E.2
:::

**Cleaning data** is the process of making the data
uniform <em>without changing its meaning</em> (such as replacing
abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the intended word or
converting miles to kilometers). Programmers can use programs to filter
and clean digital data, thereby gaining insight and knowledge.

::: ap-standard
DAT-2.C.5
:::

Imagine you read in the news that people who eat a lot of broccoli
are less likely to get cancer. The conclusion that broccoli prevents
cancer could be a result of <em>bias</em>. It could be that people who
eat a lot of broccoli tend to be the same people who also get a lot of
exercise, and it's actually the exercise that makes the difference. In
research, the term "bias" doesn't have to mean prejudice; it's about
reasons the data might not mean what they seem to mean.

People sometimes think that the way to overcome bias is to use a
bigger sample (asking more people if they eat broccoli and have cancer).
But if the bigger sample has the same problem (people getting more
exercise also eat more broccoli), then a bigger sample won't eliminate
the bias.
