<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will learn about <em>metadata</em>
(data about data) and how they can be used.</p>

::: ap-standard
DAT-2.B.1
:::

<p><strong>Metadata</strong> are data about data. For example, the piece
of data may be an image, while the metadata may include the date of
creation or the file size of the image.</p>
:::

::: ap-standard
DAT-2.B.2, DAT-2.B.3, DAT-2.B.4, DAT-2.B.5
:::

<p>Data can even include <em>data about itself</em>. For example, a
music file might contain data describing the song title, artist, album,
genre, record label, etc. Or an image file might include data for the
date that the picture was taken, the location where it was taken,
information about the camera settings, the serial number of the specific
camera, etc. This kind of information about data is called
<strong>metadata</strong>. Metadata tell you additional information
about the data you are working with and can be used to organize and
manage your data. For example, you can use metadata to find all of your
photos from a particular time and place or to restrict access to all
videos recorded by your old phone. Metadata are connected to but
different from your data and can be changed without impacting the
primary data. For example, changing the album name of a song won't
change what the song sounds like.</p>

<p>Because metadata are often not displayed by software, it's easy to
violate privacy without realizing it when posting data online...</p>

"...an electronic camera is not just a camera. Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows is, as far as anyone knows, the last book in the Harry
Potter series. Its arrival was eagerly awaited, with lines of anxious
Harry fans stretching around the block at bookstores everywhere. One fan
got a prerelease copy, painstakingly photographed every page, and posted
the entire book online before the official release. A labor of love, no
doubt, but a blatant copyright violation as well. He doubtless figured
he was just posting the pixels, which could not be traced back to him.
If that was his presumption, he was wrong. <strong>His digital
fingerprints were all over the images.</strong> (<em>Blown to Bits</em>,
page 24, emphasis added)

Brian, you want to make the point that privacy of metadata is important.

These questions about metadata are similar to those you will see on the
AP CSP exam. <!-- Question 1 -->

::: {.assessment-data type="multiplechoice" identifier="mobile phone recording metadata" hasinlinefeedback="true" maxchoices="1" responseidentifier="ri1" shuffle="true"}
::: prompt
A new mobile phone company---unbeknownst to its customers---periodically
records random snippets of their conversations and considers the
recordings as data. In addition, it collects the following metadata on
the conversations:

<ul>

<li>The start and end time of the conversation</li>

<li>The phone numbers of the users in the conversation</li>

<li>The GPS locations of the users in the conversation</li>

</ul>

<p>For which of the following goals would it be more useful to analyze
the <em><strong>data</strong></em> instead of the
<em><strong>metadata</strong></em>?</p>
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c1"}
::: text
To determine if any of its users was present at the time and place of a
crime.
:::

::: feedback
For this purpose, GPS and time information (in the metadata) would be
more useful.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c2"}
::: text
To determine the time of day the app is used most frequently in a
certain geographic location.
:::

::: feedback
For this purpose, GPS and time information (in the metadata) would be
more useful.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c3"}
::: text
To determine the language most commonly used in user conversations.
:::

::: feedback
Correct. For this purpose, the conversation data itself would be
analyzed.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c4"}
::: text
To determine the most active users of the app for a given year.
:::

::: feedback
For this purpose, user phone numbers and time information (in the
metadata) would be more useful.
:::
:::

::: {.responseDeclaration identifier="ri1"}
::: {.correctResponse identifier="c3"}

<!-- Question 2 -->

::: {.assessment-data type="multiplechoice" identifier="example of metadata" hasinlinefeedback="true" maxchoices="1" responseidentifier="ri2" shuffle="true"}
::: prompt
Which of the following is <em><strong>not</strong></em> an example of
<em>metadata</em>?
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c1"}
::: text
Data about a digital image describing the size of the image, image
resolution, color depth, and when the image was created.
:::

::: feedback
This is an example of data about data.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c2"}
::: text
Data about a text document containing information about the length of
the document, its author, the date the document was written, and a short
summary of the content.
:::

::: feedback
This is an example of data about data.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c3"}
::: text
Data about a pack of wolves describing their habitat, hunting habits,
diet, and sleep cycles.
:::

::: feedback
Correct. Data about wolves is not data about data.
:::
:::

::: {.choice identifier="c4"}
::: text
Data about a web page containing a description of page content and a
list of key words linked to the content.
:::

::: feedback
This is an example of data about data.
:::
:::

::: {.responseDeclaration identifier="ri2"}
::: {.correctResponse identifier="c3"}
