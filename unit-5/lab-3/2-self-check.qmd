**On this page**, you will prepare for data questions on
the AP exam.

The size of a data set affects the amount of information that can be
extracted from it. The datasets you work with in this course are small
compared to the "big data" used to look at trends in Internet searches,
environmental research, or financial technology. Large data sets
(billions or trillions of entries) are difficult to process using a
single computer and may require parallel computing across multiple
systems; scalability becomes an issue because the computational capacity
of a system can impact how data sets can be processed and stored.

These questions are similar to those you will see on the AP CSP exam.
