<p>MF: lightly clean up to make the text more concise</p>

<p>This page is long and there are so many things to research. I paced
it at 60-120 min, and marked it skippable. --MF, 5/31/20</p>

<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will consider several examples of
computer-based military technology.</p>
:::

<p>When you were listing military technologies, did you think of
cryptography? GPS? Those technologies have other uses too, but they're
of definite military importance, and were developed mainly for military
use. Cryptography is older than computers, but modern cryptography
depends on computers, and some of the earliest computers were developed
for that purpose.</p>

<li>What other computer-based military technology can you think of?</li>

</ol>
:::

<p>On this page we're going to focus on three really important
computer-based military technologies.</p>

<h3>Malware</h3>

<p>You learned about malware on
<a href="/unit-4/lab-2/5-security-risks.html" title="You learned about malware on Unit 4 Lab 2 Page 5: Security Risks">Unit
4 Lab 2 Page 5: Security Risks</a>. This is a general name for all kinds
of programs intended to do harm, including viruses (which copy
themselves like real viruses), DNS spoofing, phishing, and denial of
service software.</p>

<p>Malware is generally used either just to make trouble or to steal
money. But various countries' military groups are actively developing
malware to disrupt an enemy country's communications or technology
centers.</p>

which is the best-known military malware attack. You can also research

<h3>Autonomous weapons</h3>

<p>An <strong>autonomous</strong> weapon is one that can decide to fire
itself without human decision-making. You can see why the military might
want autonomous weapons.</p>

<ol start="3">

<li>Look up the amount of time between the detection of a missile attack
on the US and the actual explosion of the incoming missiles.</li>

</ol>
:::

<p>On the other hand, autonomous weapons raise the possibility that a
programming error could start a nuclear war <em>by accident.</em></p>

automated false alarms caused by

<p>

In all of these cases, what prevented the outbreak of World War III is
that some human expert didn't trust the automatic missile detectors and,
sometimes in violation of direct orders, refused to attack the other
side.

<p>In 1983, then-President Ronald Reagan announced a program called the
"Strategic Defense Initiative" (SDI) that would have placed military
satellites in orbit, equipped with both missile detectors and
anti-missile weapons, including high-energy lasers. The satellites would
be equipped with computers that would detect an enemy attack, aim its
weapons at incoming missiles, and destroy them. The project became known
by the (sarcastic) nickname "Star Wars."</p>

::: forYouToDo
<ol start="5">

<li>Look up "Strategic Defense Initiative," and some of the
controversies surrounding it, both in 1983 and in later revivals of the
idea.</li>

<li>Look up the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which SDI would have
violated. Why would a treaty limit <em>defensive</em> weapons rather
than <em>offensive</em> ones?</li>

<h3>Drones</h3>

<p><strong>Drones</strong> are remotely piloted aircraft. They vary in
size from toys for hobbyists to bombers used in warfare. The remote
control depends on computers both in the airplane and on the ground.</p>

<p>"Many contend that President Bush's re-election and increased vote
share prove that the Iraq War was either irrelevant or even an asset to
him. We present evidence to the contrary. Focusing on the change in
Bush's 2004 showing compared to 2000, we discover that Iraq War
casualties from a state significantly depressed the President's vote
share there. We infer that were it not for the approximately 10,000 U.S.
dead and wounded in Iraq by Election Day, Bush would have won nearly 2%
more of the popular vote, carrying several additional states and winning
decisively... In contrast, National Guard/Reservist call-ups had no
significant additional effect beyond the main casualty effect."</p>

<p>--- "Iraq War Casualties and the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election,"
David Karol and Edward Miguel, 2004</p>
:::

<p>For an elected president, there are political benefits and political
costs to starting a war. A benefit is that when a war starts, especially
if voters feel that their country is under attack, a war makes people
feel patriotic, and that is reflected in greater approval of the
president. That's the primary effect until American soldiers die. Voters
disapprove of American deaths. In the study quoted above, the
researchers examined George W. Bush's approval ratings <em>state by
state,</em> and found that his rating was measurably lower in states
from which more soldiers had died.</p>

<p>The risk of American deaths, leading to votes against the president's
party, is what keeps presidents from fighting unnecessary wars. It's
also why Barack Obama promised "no American boots on the ground" in the
war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>Drone aircraft are important mainly because they make it easier to
start a war in which no Americans die. The pilots are in the US, not in
the country being bombed. It's not that the drones are faster or more
accurate or otherwise better from a strictly military viewpoint; it's
that they're <em>politically</em> valuable, making it easier to start a
war.</p>

<li>Discuss: Is making it easier for the US to start a war good or bad?
Come up with some arguments on <em>both sides</em> before deciding on
your answer.</li>

<li>Discuss: "The US are the good guys, so we won't start a war unless
it's in a good cause." This
