<a name="box1" >&nbsp;</a>
<div class="ap-standard">AAP-4.A.1</div>
<ul>
<li>A **problem** is a general description of a task that may (or may not) be solved algorithmically.</li>
<li>An **instance of a problem** is one case of a problem, with specific inputs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-1/2-how-many-five-letter-words.html" title="/unit-5/lab-1/2-how-many-five-letter-words.html">5.1.2</a>**: **Linear Search** or **Sequential Search**
<a name="box2" >&nbsp;</a>
<ul>
<li>An algorithm takes **linear time** if multiplying the input size by ten multiplies the time required by ten.<br />

</li>
<div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.O.5</div>
<li>A **linear search** (or **sequential search**) algorithm checks each element of a list in order, a process which takes <em>linear time</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-1/3-spell-checker.html" title="/unit-5/lab-1/3-spell-checker.html">5.1.3</a>**: **Binary Search**
<a name="box3" >&nbsp;</a>
<div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.P.1, AAP-2.P.2</div>
A **binary search** algorithm starts in the middle of a <em>sorted</em> list and repeatedly eliminates half the list until either the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.
<div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.O.1</div>
<div class="sidenoteBig">You learned about traversing a list on <a href="/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/3-traversing-list.html" title="Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 3: Checking Each Quiz Answer">Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 3: Checking Each Quiz Answer</a>.</div>
Linear search does a <em>complete</em> traversal of the list. Binary search saves time by doing a <em>partial</em> traversal of the list.
</div>

<a name="box4" >&nbsp;</a>
<div class="ap-standard">AAP-4.A.3</div>
The relationship between the input size and the number of steps required to solve a problem is the **efficiency** of the algorithm used to solve the problem.
</div>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-1/5-categorizing-algorithms.html" title="/unit-5/lab-1/5-categorizing-algorithms.html">5.1.5</a>**
<a name="box5" >&nbsp;</a>
<ul>
<li>An algorithm takes **linear time** the number of steps is proportional to the input size; doubling the input size doubles the time required.</li>
<li>An algorithm takes **sublinear time** if the number of steps grows more slowly than the size.</li>
<li>An algorithm takes **constant time** if it takes the same number of steps regardless of input size.</li>
<li>An algorithm takes **quadratic time** if the number of steps is proportional to the <em>square</em> of the input size.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-1/5-categorizing-algorithms.html" title="/unit-5/lab-1/5-categorizing-algorithms.html">5.1.5</a>**
<a name="box6" >&nbsp;</a>
<ul>
<li>
An algorithm takes **polynomial time** if the number of steps is less than or equal to a power of the size of the input, such as constant (<em>n</em><sup>0</sup>), sublinear, linear (<em>n</em><sup>1</sup>), quadratic (<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>), or cubic (<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>).

</li>
<li>
An algorithm takes **exponential time** if the number of steps is proportional to an exponential function of the size of the input, such as 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>, 10<sup><em>n</em></sup>, etc., which is much slower than any polynomial.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-1/6-heuristics.html" title="/unit-5/lab-1/6-heuristics.html">5.1.6</a>**
<a name="box7" >&nbsp;</a>
<div class="ap-standard">AAP-4.A.2</div>
<ul>
<li>A **decision problem** is a problem with a true/false answer (for example, "is 5,825,496,221 a prime number?").</li>
<li>An **optimization problem** is one with the goal of finding the <em>best</em> solution among many (for example, "what's the best school schedule to place every student into as many of their requested classes as possible?").</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-1/6-heuristics.html" title="/unit-5/lab-1/6-heuristics.html">5.1.6</a>**
<a name="box8" >&nbsp;</a>
<div class="ap-standard">AAP-4.B.1, AAP-4.B.2, AAP-4.B.3</div>
A **decidable** problem a decision problem for which it's possible to write an algorithm that will give a correct output for all inputs. 
An **undecidable** problem is the opposite. It's <em>not</em> possible to write an algorithm that will give a correct output for all inputs&mdash;even though it might be possible for some of them.

<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-1/8-sequential.html" title="/unit-5/lab-1/8-sequential.html">5.1.8</a>**: **Sequential** and **Parallel Computing**
<a name="box9" >&nbsp;</a>
<div class="ap-standard">CSN-2.A.1, CSN-2.A.2</div>

This section covers two computational models:
<ul>
<li>In **sequential computing**, operations are performed in order one at a time.</li>
<li>In **parallel computing**, the program is broken into smaller steps, some of which are performed at the same time. Modern computers have multiple processors (2, 4, or 8) in a single computer, so you can do small-scale parallel processing on the machine on your desk.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-1/8-sequential.html" title="/unit-5/lab-1/8-sequential.html">5.1.8</a>**
<a name="box10" >&nbsp;</a>
<div class="ap-standard">CSN-2.A.3</div>
**Distributed computing** is a form of parallel computing that uses multiple computers (perhaps even spread out around the world).
</div>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-1/8-sequential.html" title="/unit-5/lab-1/8-sequential.html">5.1.8</a>**

<a name="box12" >&nbsp;</a>
<div class="ap-standard">CSN-2.A.7</div>

Programmers refer to the **speedup** of parallel solution to describe how many times as fast the parallel solution is compared to the sequential solution:
$$\text{speedup} = \frac{\text{sequential time}}{\text{parallel time}}$$

<h3>Lab 2: Simulations</h3>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-2/1-intro-to-simulations.html" title="/unit-5/lab-2/1-intro-to-simulations.html">5.2.1</a>**
<a name="box13" >&nbsp;</a>
<div class="ap-standard">AAP-3.F.1, AAP-3.F.2</div>
**Simulations** are computer representations of real things or situations that vary over time. A simulation is an abstraction designed for a particular purpose.
</div>
<h3>Lab 3: Turning Data into Information</h3>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-3/1-health-data.html" title="/unit-5/lab-3/1-health-data.html">5.3.1</a>**: **Data** vs. **Information**
<a name="box14" >&nbsp;</a>
<div class="ap-standard">DAT-2.A.1</div>
<ul>
<li>**Data** are the values that computers receive from various sources, including human activity, sensors, etc.</li>
<li>**Information** is the humanly-useful patterns extracted from data.</li>
</ul>
<div class="ap-standard">DAT-2.A.2</div>Data provide opportunities for identifying trends, making connections, and addressing problems. Information is the result of analyzing that data.
</div>

A **correlation** is a particular kind of information, namely a dependence between two variables. For example in the first picture here, as one variable goes up the other goes down. It's also a correlation when as one variable goes up or down the other changes in the same manner.

<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-3/3-importing-data.html" title="/unit-5/lab-3/3-importing-data.html">5.3.3</a>**: **Records**, **Fields**, and **Columns**
<a name="box17" >&nbsp;</a>
<ul>
<li>A **record** is one row in a dataset (other than the first row, which contains the column headings). A single record might be the data for one student in your school, the data for one earthquake that happened, the data for one hospital in the U.S, or the data for one contact in your contact list. In other words, a record is a horizontal slice of the dataset.</li>
<li>A **field** is one item of a record in a dataset. It might be one person's homeroom teacher, the magnitude of an earthquake in Los Angeles last week, the owner of one hospital in Chicago, or the phone number of one person in your contact list.</li>
<li>A **column** is a list containing the data from one field for all records in a dataset. A column might be the homeroom teacher for <em>every</em> student in your school, the magnitude of <em>every</em> earthquake in the dataset, the owner of <em>every</em> hospital in the U.S., or the phone number of <em>every</em> person in your contact list. In other words, a column is a vertical slice of the dataset.</li>

**Cleaning data** is the process of making the data uniform <em>without changing its meaning</em> (such as replacing abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the intended word or converting miles to kilometers). Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data, thereby gaining insight and knowledge.

<h3>Lab 4: Unsolvable and Undecidable Problems</h3>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-4/1-logical-inconsistency.html" title="/unit-5/lab-4/1-logical-inconsistency.html">5.4.1</a>**
<a name="box22" >&nbsp;</a>

A **proof by contradiction** is a two-step proof that a statement is false, which is done by:
<ol>
<li>assuming the statement is true</li>
<li>based on that assumption, proving something known to be false (that is, showing the assumption creates a contradiction)</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-4/1-logical-inconsistency.html" title="/unit-5/lab-4/1-logical-inconsistency.html">5.4.1</a>**
<a name="box23" >&nbsp;</a>
An **undecidable** statement might be true or might be false; we don't know which.
A **self-contradictory** statement can be neither true nor false.
</div>
<div class="vocabSummary" >** <a href="/unit-5/lab-4/2-halting-problem.html" title="/unit-5/lab-4/2-halting-problem.html">5.4.2</a>**
<a name="box24" >&nbsp;</a>
An **infinite loop** is a sequence of computer instructions that repeats forever.
An **unsolvable problem** is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution.
An **undecidable problem** is one for which no algorithm can ever be written that will always give a correct <em>true/false decision</em> for every input value. Undecidable problems are a subcategory of unsolvable problems that include only problems that should have a yes/no answer (such as: does my code have a bug?).
