<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will see how long it takes to run
a <em>linear search</em> algorithm.</p>

<p>On
<a href="/unit-2/lab-3/6-solving-word-puzzle.html" title="Unit 2 Lab 3 Page 6: Solving a Word Puzzle">Unit
2 Lab 3 Page 6: Solving a Word Puzzle</a>, you built a

block and used it with <code>keep</code> to find words of a specific
length in a word list. <strong>How long does a process like that
take?</strong></p>

This project provides the variables <var>1,000 words</var>, <var>10,000
words</var>, and <var>100,000 words</var> (each containing a list of
words) and a copy of the <code>does () have () letters?</code>
predicate.

</li>

<li>How many five-letter words are in the <var>10,000 words</var>
list?</li>

<li>Use the
<img src="/img/5-algorithms/computation-time-of.png" title="computation time of &apos;grey ring input slot&apos;" alt="computation time of &apos;grey ring input slot&apos;" class="inline"/>
block provided in this project to determine how long it takes for the
computer to answer that question.</li>

</ol>
:::

<p>The <code>computation time</code> block takes any reporter (with its
inputs filled in), computes the result but ignores it, and instead
reports <em>how long it took</em> to do the computation (in
milliseconds).<br />
<img src="/img/5-algorithms/computation-time-reporting.png" title="computation time of (numbers from (1) to (1000)) reporting 27" alt="computation time of (numbers from (1) to (1000)) reporting 27" class="indent"/></p>

<p>In this example, it took 27 milliseconds to compute the list of
integers from 1 to 1000. (The report you see will depend on how fast
your computer is and what other programs are running on it.)</p>

<p>You can look inside <code>computation time</code> to see how it
works: Right-click (or control-click on a mac) the block and select
"edit..." from the menu that appears.</p>

::: forYouToDo
<ol start="4">

<li>Click on the <code>computation time</code> expression you just used
to answer the previous question three more times and note the range of
answers. They're not exactly the same because of other things that your
computer is doing at the same time, so you should always take whatever
result it gives you as <em>approximate</em>.</li>

How long do you think it would take to count five-letter words if the
list had 100,000 words?</li>

<li>Use <code>computation time</code> to check using the <var>100,000
words</var> list.</li>

<p>Searching for all the five-letter words in a specific word list is an
<em>instance</em> of a more general problem: searching for all the words
of any particular length.</p>

Suppose instead, we count the <em>seven</em>-letter words. Will this
take...
<img src="/img/icons/write-out-thoughts.png" title="Write Out Your Thoughts" alt="Write Out Your Thoughts" class="imageRight"/>

<ol>

<li>More time because seven letters is more than five letters?</li>

<li>Less time because there are fewer seven-letter words than
five-letter words?</li>

<li>The same time because it's not the word length that matters; it's
the size of the dictionary?</li>

I was thrown off by the format of this exercise and rephrased it as a
question. --MF, 5/31/20

<p>Should this maybe be a quizlet? Not sure... --MF, 7/13/20</p>

</li>

<li>Experiment to find out for sure.</li>

</ol>
:::

<p>The only way to answer a "How many words..." problem is to check
every single word in the dictionary. So if you have <strong>ten times as
many</strong> words in the dictionary, it takes <strong>ten times as
long</strong> to check them all.</p>
