<p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you will use two different algorithms
to search a list, and you will learn that algorithms are categorized by
the time required to run them.</p>

<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will modify your number guessing
game from Unit 2 to make the computer do the guessing.</p>

You built a number guessing game in

<li>Play a few times. Keep track of how many guesses it takes you to
identify the number each time.</li>

Develop a strategy that will identify the secret number in no more than
6 guesses.</li>

<li><img src="/img/icons/write-out-thoughts-mini.png" title="Write Out Your Thoughts" alt="Write Out Your Thoughts" class="inline"/>
Write down your strategy clearly enough for others to use it to play the
game.</li>

Then compare your algorithm with another pair of students.</li>

<li>

Now make <em>the computer</em> guess <em>your</em> number using this
strategy.

There are three sprites with costumes ("too small,"just right," and "too
big") that are hidden in your project file. Use the `show`
block in the "Looks" menu to see them.
