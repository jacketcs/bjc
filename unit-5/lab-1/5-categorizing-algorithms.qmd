    There are several different ways to sort a list, some of which you will
    learn about in Unit 8. This `sort` block uses an "insertion
    sort" algorithm.

You can classify algorithms by the amount of time they take to run.
<!--To classify an algorithm, you look at the number of steps it takes to complete the algorithm and compare it to the size of the input. For example, `25,000 integers` takes <em>constant time:</em> computing 25,000 integers starting at seven takes as long as computing 25,000 integers starting at seven million. As a second example, `linear search` takes <em>linear time:</em> if you have ten times as many words in the dictionary, then it takes ten times as long to search through them all. As a third example, consider the `sort` algorithm you timed. It takes <em>quadratic time:</em> multiplying the input size by ten multiplies the time required by 10<sup>2</sup>. As another example, consider the `binary search` algorithm you timed. In binary search, multiplying the input size by ten <em>adds</em> a constant amount to the time required instead of multiplying by a constant amount. This is an example of <em>sublinear time</em>.-->

:::::: forYouToDo
::: vocabBig

- An algorithm takes **linear time** the number of steps
is proportional to the input size; doubling the input size doubles the
time required.

- An algorithm takes **sublinear time** if the number of
steps grows more slowly than the size.

- An algorithm takes **constant time** if it takes the
same number of steps regardless of input size.

- An algorithm takes **quadratic time** if the number of
steps is proportional to the <em>square</em> of the input size.

(@) Look back at your table for `linear search`. Confirm that multiplying the list length by ten roughly multiplies the time taken by ten (<em>linear time</em>).<!--the search time for the <var>100,000 word list</var> is (about) ten times as long as the time for the <var>10,000 word list</var>, which is (about) ten times as long as the time for the <var>1,000 word list</var>.-->

(@) Look back at your table for `binary search`. Confirm that the search time for each word list is less than for linear search (<em>sublinear time</em>).

(@) Look back at your table for `25,000 integers`. Confirm that it takes about the same amount of time regardless of the input (<em>constant time</em>).

(@) Look back at your table for `sort`. Confirm that multiplying the list length by ten roughly multiplies the time taken by
one hundred (<em>quadratic time</em>).<!--Confirm that the time to sort the <var>100,000 word list</var> is (about) one hundred times as long as the time for the <var>10,000 word list</var>, which is (about) one hundred times as long as the time for the <var>1,000 word list</var>.--></li>

::::::

The difference between linear search and binary search can be very important if you're searching in a list of ten million items, but the <em>most</em> important difference in algorithm efficiency is between polynomial time (proportional to any power of the input size) and exponential time.

::: vocabFullWidth
<ul>

<li>An algorithm takes **polynomial time** if the number of steps is less than or equal to a power of the size of the input, such as constant (<em>n</em><sup>0</sup>), sublinear, linear (<em>n</em><sup>1</sup>), quadratic (<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>), or cubic (<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>).</li>

<li>An algorithm takes **exponential time** if the number of steps is proportional to an exponential function of the size of the input, such as 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>, 10<sup><em>n</em></sup>, etc., which is much slower than any polynomial.</li>

</ul>
:::

In an exponential time algorithm, just <em>adding 1</em> to the input size (<em>n</em>) of a 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> time algorithm <em>doubles</em> the number of steps! So, for example, if the input size is 20, <em>any</em> polynomial time algorithm will be fast enough, but an exponential time algorithm might take many <em>years</em> to finish.

One reason it's worth learning these categories is to avoid
reinventing the wheel. For example, you've learned that if a list is
sorted you can search it in sublinear time using binary search. So when
you're writing a program that needs to search through a list repeatedly,
it's worthwhile to sort the list before searching. Knowing about
algorithms that already exist can help you construct new algorithms.

All of the algorithms you've explored so far in this lab
(`linear search`; `binary search`; `25,000
integers`; and `sort`) are reasonable time algorithms.
The following optional activity is an example of an exponential time
algorithm.

:::::: ifTime

A problem that may be familiar that requires an exponential time
algorithm is computing any given element of Pascal's Triangle. In
Pascal's Triangle, each number is found by adding the two numbers above
it. For example, 4 + 6 = 10 and 15 + 6 = 21 as shown below. The first
and last number of each row, which don't have two numbers above them
are 1. <br />

    the table as far as the speed of your computer will allow.

    The <var>row</var> value is the input to `pascals triangle`
    that matters. (The <var>position</var> input is only given so you get a
    time for one of the positions near the middle of the row, which take
    longer to compute.)
    :::

    These <var>row</var> inputs are very small compared to the input size
    for the `linear search`, `binary search`, and
    `sort` algorithms, and yet the time required for
    `pascals triangle` is much higher. Your computer probably
    can't do much past <var>25</var>.

    ::: endnote
    This algorithm works by adding the two numbers above using the algorithm
    inside itself recursively, but there are better algorithms that compute
    the value a number in Pascal's Triangle in linear time.
