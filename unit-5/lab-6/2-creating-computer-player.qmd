<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll make the computer play against
the human player.</p>
:::

<p>The game currently allows two human players to take turns playing.
But you don't really need a computer to keep track of moves for two
human players. We want the human player to take turns with a computer
player that will move automatically. To simplify the project, we'll
assume that the human player will always move first (playing X) and that
the computer is playing O.</p>

<h3>Have the Computer Move Randomly</h3>

<p>For now, you'll create a computer player that moves to
<em>random</em> positions on the board. (It won't be a very good player,
but you'll fix that once the structure of the code for the computer's
move is in place.) Once the program decides where it wants to move,
you'll use <code>broadcast</code> to send a message to tell the clone
with the matching <var>position number</var> to record a move. (For the
human player, <code>when I am clicked</code> serves this purpose, but
the computer's moves aren't prompted by the user clicking a square.)</p>

Recall that clones are temporary copies of a sprite. You learned about
them in

<p><code>Broadcast</code> sends out a message to all the sprites in the
project. Any scripts that start with <code>when I receive</code> and
have a matching message in the input slot will run.</p>

<p>If you select "any message" from the <code>when I receive</code>
dropdown menu and you click the right-pointing triangle, you can use the
<code>data</code> variable to access the message.<br />

<li>If it isn't open already, open your U5L6-TicTacToe project.</li>

<li>Find the script that starts <code>when I am clicked</code>. That
script handles a move by the human player. Now start a new script next
to it:<br />
<img src="/img/5-algorithms/when-receive.png" title="when I receive (any message) : if (message) = (square number) [nothing in script slot yet]" alt="when I receive (any message) : if (message) = (square number) [nothing in script slot yet]" class="indent"/></li>

<li>Create an abstraction to contain everything inside the
<code>if</code> statement from the <code>when I am (clicked)</code>
script and use it in both scripts.<br />
<img src="/img/5-algorithms/when-clicked.png" title="when I am (clicked) {
if ((costume #) = 1) {
move in this square
}

move in this square
}
}" class="indent"/>

In order to debug the <code>when I receive</code> script, edit the
<code>move in this square</code> block. After your code for Player X's
turn, <em>temporarily</em> pick a random vacant square and use
<code>broadcast</code> with that square number as the message. (If your
<code>when I receive</code> script is working, the computer will move in
the corresponding square.)

<h3>Give the Computer a Simple Strategy</h3>

<p>Instead of having the computer move at random, you will start to give
the computer some strategy. Unlike people, all squares on the
tic-tac-toe board are <em>not</em> created equal. Playing in the center
(position 5) or on a corner (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9) is better than
playing on an edge (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).<br />

Why is playing in the center or a corner better than an edge? Compare
your explanation with that of other students.<br></li>

Create a

block that reports the best position on the board that is not yet
filled. Use it as input to your <code>broadcast</code> instruction in
place of <code>random</code>.
