<!--<p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you'll make the computer play against the human player <em>strategically</em>.</p>-->

<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll define the strategy that the
computer will use by investigating the strategies that humans use.</p>
:::

<p>You've already built into your project the most basic Tic-Tac-Toe
strategy rule: the computer will move to the <code>best empty
square</code> on its turn. But there are other important elements to a
good strategy...</p>

::: {#first .forYouToDo}
<ol>

<li>Play a couple of games of Tic-Tac-Toe with your partner on
paper.</li>

<li>Discuss your strategy with your partner, and write out a list of
if/then rules that you both use to play (for example, "if such-and-such
is the case, then play here").</li>

</ol>
:::

<p>The strategy rules for Tic-Tac-Toe have different degrees of
priority. For example, the most important rule is "if I can win on this
turn, then play in the winning square."</p>

::: forYouToDo
<ol start="3">

<li>What's the second most important rule?</li>

<li><img src="/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner" alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="imageRight"/>
Think through how the computer can determine if a player can win on
their next turn. The <code>won?</code> block works by looking for a
triple in which all three slots are X or all three slots are O. Describe
what the slots of a triple will contain if player O can win on their
next move by filling that triple's last square.</li>

</ol>
:::

::: endnote
These three rules (if you can win on this move, do so; if the other
player can win on their next move, block them; and otherwise just pick
the best empty square) are part of most human Tic-Tac-Toe strategies.
But the best players develop additional rules that come after the first
two but before the last. You can explore some of these rules in the Take
It Further problems at the end of the lab.

<ol start="5">

You're going to start implementing "If I can win..." and "If the other
player can win..." rules, starting by detecting those situations.

<li>Make a block
<img src="/img/5-algorithms/how-many-x-in-x-5-x-reporting.png" title="number of (X) in (list{X,5,X}) reporting 2" alt="number of (X) in (list{X,5,X}) reporting 2"/>.</li>

<li>Look inside the
<img src="/img/5-algorithms/wonp-x.png" title="won? (X)" alt="won? (X)"/>
block that you wrote in Unit 3. Remind yourself how it finds a triple
that has three in a row of the desired X or O.</li>

A possible winning triple for O on the next move has \_\_\_\_ Os and
\_\_\_\_ Xs.

Now write
<img src="/img/5-algorithms/winning-triple-for-player.png" title="winning triple for player ()" alt="winning triple for player ()"/>.
It should report the first triple it finds that contains a place where
the player could win on the next move.<br />

</li>

<li>Play part of a game, and then test <code>winning triple</code> for
both inputs (X and O). Play a little more, and then test them both
again. Fix any bugs.</li>

<li>What does <code>winning triple</code> report if there is no winning
triple?</li>

<li>Now write the
<img src="/img/5-algorithms/winning-square-for-player.png" title="winning square for player ()" alt="winning square for player ()"/>
block. Make sure it works even if there is no winning square.</li>
