<p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you'll extend your
<a href="/unit-3/lab-3/1-find-ties.html" title="Tic-Tac-Toe program">Tic-Tac-Toe
program</a> to make the computer play against you.</p>

<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll review the blocks in your
previous Tic-Tac-Toe project.</p>

<ol>

<li>Open your <strong>U3L3-TicTacToe</strong> project, and save it as
<strong>U5L6-TicTacToe</strong> so you'll still have your old version as
a backup.</li>

<li>

Play part of a game, stop before finishing, and then click on each of
the following blocks.
<img src="/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner" alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline"/>
Discuss what each expression does and how its code works.

<ol type="a">

<li><img src="/img/5-algorithms/board.png" title="board" alt="board"/></li>

::: sidenote
You can edit a block to remind yourself of how it works if you've
forgotten.
:::

<li><img src="/img/5-algorithms/possible-winning-triples.png" title="possible winning triples" alt="possible winning triples"/></li>

<li><img src="/img/5-algorithms/status-of-all-winning-triples.png" title="status of all winning triples" alt="status of all winning triples"/></li>

<li><img src="/img/5-algorithms/wonp-x.png" title="won? (X)" alt="won? (X)"/></li>

</ol>

</li>

<li><img src="/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" title="Talk with Another Pair" alt="Talk with Another Pair" class="imageRight"/>
Two of these blocks report what's on the board but in different ways:
<code>status of all winning triples</code> and <code>board</code>. Why
do you need both of those? When do you use each of them?</li>

<li>What tells the program that clicking in a square means to move in
that square? How does it know which square you clicked?</li>

</ol>
